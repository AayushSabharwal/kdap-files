<root><question Id="31340" Title="Who is the boy at the end of Feng Shen Ji Season 3?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Some people say he is Shen Yen, but how? They don't look alike at all, and Shen Yen should have been dead by then. So, who is this boy?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnX30.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnX30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Who is this boy?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36440">&lt;p&gt;The boy is Wei Shan, Kong Que's son who we have all forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWpvt.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWpvt.jpg" alt="Wei Shan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is said to be the next Shen Yen for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is a firm believer of Shen Yen's ideals. Also, he has a crystal clenched in his fist and a pair of eyes burning for revenge in the last pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five white marks above his eyes, likely the source of power for the five different rays of light possessed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Xuan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kong Xuan&lt;/a&gt; (whom Wei Shan is modeled after), look oddly like Shen Yen's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;If I'm not mistaken, the Deucalion was stuck to the side of Saazbaum's landing castle right? How come on the Season 2 Episode 1 scene where Yuki rescued Inaho, they were underwater?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38069">&lt;p&gt;I figured out the answer myself. It's because it was a jump cut. The moment Inaho touched the Aldnoah drive, it had a jump cut to the present time where the Deucalion was underwater because they are docked at the beach where we saw Inko and the rest of the girls in bikinis prior. So it was just a jump cut that wasn't very clearly executed.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Crunchyroll licences anime for simultaneous streaming (simultaneous with the Japanese TV airing, in some cases), so it should have early access to the material to be translated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I won't touch on how they do it or who does it; what I am interested in knowing is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is the translation shown in CR to be taken as the official translation?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18495">&lt;p&gt;Since Crunchyroll has a license from the copyright owner, the content (including cuts / edited video, subtitles, translations, overlay text, dubbing) available is considered official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Crunchyroll does the translation, the translation is owned by the  anime studio. Also, sometimes the studio chooses how some terms are translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many elements from the show were inspired by him as well from the tissue box, to the flower crowns Viktor wore, Viktor's custom gold blades, and right down to Viktor's feathered costume. All of those things were known and inspired by Johnny. The feathered costume came from his first Olympics as a swan skating to Swan Lake. Every time he won a comp. Johnny got a flower crown, and Johnny's favorite color was gold so he got custom made gold blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these were inspirations from Johnny Weir.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Kale's first transformation (the bulky one with blank eyes) was officially called super saiyan berseker. Now from Broly's movie, we knew a similar transformation was called the legendary super saiyan transformation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was a non canon name, but in the last Dragon Ball Super episode preview they made a reference to that name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We also know Kale has at least 2 transformations, her berserker transformation, and her calm transformation (also known unofficially as super Saiyan green) and last episode preview hinted Kale could have more transformations (another calm transformation where she controls her full power, something she supposedly didn't do with super Saiyan green apparently ?  maybe a super saiyan 3 for her coming) . &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my question is, are the super Saiyan berseker and the legendary super Saiyan transformation the same transformation, or are they refers with legendary super Saiyan transformation to another transformation from Kale (not the first one we've seen from her) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43163">&lt;p&gt;It was mentioned in episode 114 that the Berserker state was basically an uncontrolled version of the LSSJ. We see Kale being able to control this enormous power and go toe to toe with SSJG Goku. So the answer to your question would be a yes!&lt;/p&gt;

While watching these filler episodes, he appears as the ANBU Kakashi, who was leading his team. Being the Senpai of Itachi he looks exactly (maybe for me) like he does in the present day... Is this a coincidence? Or couldn't the animators be bother to add additional &quot;lines&quot; to his face? Note that we've seen the newborn Naruto, that would mean that Kakashi looks the same as he did 17-18 years ago..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8624">&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/User%3aTimeel39/Timeline"&gt;this timeline&lt;/a&gt; and the following data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;September 15 Birth day Kakashi
Academy Grad. Age   5
Ch&#363;nin Prom. Age    6 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can tell that Kakashi was born 14 years before the 9-tails attack. Using the information that the Akatsuki dead line was 18 years after the 9-tails attack. we can tell that Kakashi should be roughly 32 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14088">&lt;p&gt;at the time of pain he was 30 so one year has passed in the forth great ninja war so he is 31. mr.dimitri mx you were so so close by one year. and also have we considered that kakashi died by pain and was revived so technically he restarted his life when pain revived him so isnt he really one years old. &lt;/p&gt;

Maeda is Kanon's surname, and Kazuya's family took it as their surname after their remarriage. Kazuya knows that Kanon is his stepsister, but he hides it from her. However, without any ill-feeling, Kazuya cares about her like real sister. Also, even if he shows his feeling and wanting to protect Kanon as her brother immediately, it takes quite a while to show that to Kanon's father. &lt;em&gt;(Emphasis mine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Till now it's shown that Naruto is good in Wind Element alone but Naruto's Kyuubi chakra affected the Wood Style technique used by White Zetsu and even Captain Yamato's Wood Style.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;If that's the case, then why can't Naruto use Wood Element technique?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10;&lt;em&gt;Why does Kyuubi chakra affect the Wood element alone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6569">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Yang_Release"&gt;From the following Naruto Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whenever Naruto is in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Wood Release techniques
  will react to the Yang chakra's life-giving properties and mature into
  full-grown trees within a matter of seconds, either by contact or
  close range.This was also shown to have the same effect on White
  Zetsu Army clones, whose genetic make-up is similar to that of
  plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Naruto himself doesn't directly control the effects his yang chakra has on the wood element or the white zetsu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Yang Release (&#38525;&#36929;, Y&#333;ton; Viz "Light Style") techniques, based on
  the physical energy that governs vitality, can be used to breathe life
  into form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Naruto is not explicitly using the wood element technique, as with the first hokage, yamato or the white zetsu, rather it's the yang element chakra that is resonating in the wood elelemt that provides the wood element the vitality to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

This is evident because the Marines are able to shape it into a variety of items like handcuffs, prison bars, weapons (like Smoker's sword) and even use it to coat the bottom of ships to escape Sea Kings. You can find the other limitations we know about seastone in the &lt;a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Seastone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wikia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest manga chapters, we come to know that seastone may have originated&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="34323" Title="Is there any explanation on how Z fighters control the power of their ki based attacks?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I personally find this to be one of the major plot holes on dragon ball which makes any intention on defining their real powers pretty hopeless, although if there's something that explains it, which I'm not aware of, then it's not a plot hole.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mean, depending on the situation if their ki based attacks hit something the effect can greatly change according to the situation, it can destroy just some landscape, a huge amount of it, a planet, a solar system, a galaxy...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If their energy attacks just destroy some landscape then there's no point in using them against enemies that could stand to something that would destroy a galaxy, so there's no reason for them to be used and it would be pointless. If they cannot control their destruction output everytime that there's a fight with their current power level the whole universe would be destroyed if some amount of ki based attacks are used in the fight and don't exactly go directly to one of the fighters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But maybe they can control it according to their will of how much destruction they want them to cause. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there something that explains that seemingly relative destructiveness of their ki based attacks?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34326">&lt;p&gt;I do not think they are any in-universe explanations for that. I have actually noticed some inconsistency in the damages the Z fighters can generate when fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that Dragon Ball is an old Shonen manga (first chapter was released in 1984). Back then, authors were not so rigorous and consistent with the plots and power levels as in other more recent mangas. Akira Toriyama regularly (and casually!) admits he has introduced many plot-holes in the Dragon Ball series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, when Goku defeats Frieza, he is about 150,000 times stronger than when he fought Raditz. How much stronger is Goku in Super Saiyan Blue form? I reckon it can be difficult to be consistent when such exponential strength growths are involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the latest Dragon Ball Super episodes, I suppose it is safe to say Akira Toriyama has not changed his approach to mangas and does not pay much attention to such minor inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34327">&lt;p&gt;This could all be wrong, but I have a theory based on previous information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Videl and when she first formed an energy ball, how she could barely add energy to it. The same thing applies here, except that everyone else is ripped. No one ever measures how much energy they put into Ki-based attacks, but we can easily assume it will be only as much energy as they can use, at most. In order to measure how much, we have to consider how strong everyone else is, in comparison to Videl. If she were put at the bottom of the scale, even above Hercule Satan, then based on everyone else's current power level, we can measure how much energy they all have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine how much energy is pumped into any Ki-based attacks, therefore defining if each amount is different and determining if Z fighters control the power of their Ki-based attacks based on which attacks they use in the 1st place, we would need to use Videl's attack as a basic scale, assuming she is the weakest above Hercule. It would require a measurement system based on weighted power, but it would help accurately measure the attacks' power, based on what does how much damage to whom in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

There had been years of peace so we see Goten and Trunks all grown to teenagers, yet in the Super series they are still young. So it seems that Uub does not exist yet and the Super series does not follow directly after the Dragon Ball series, the same way the GT series did. So where does it fit in? When does the Super series take place?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="25881">&lt;p&gt;In the last episodes of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Z&lt;/em&gt;, the Tenkaichi Tournament takes place 10 years after Buu's defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pan is one of the tournament participants, at the age of 4.&lt;br&gt;
Goten and Trunks are teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Super&lt;/em&gt;, Pan is still in Videl's womb.&lt;br&gt;
Trunks and Goten are still kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can say that Dragon Ball Super takes place before that tournament and after Buu's defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

When did Professor Agasa add this feature to Conan's glasses?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="33828">&lt;p&gt;according to the detective conan wiki:4
Agasa updated the glasses so they can zoom in on a distant target and enhance visibility, even in the dark.
As of the anime episode The Unsmashable Snowman and Volume 54, Conan's glasses can only have some form of magnifying lens. This lens is on the right, according to the manga, while the Criminal Tracking Glasses feature is on the left lens. Movie 8 and Movie 11 are the only appearances that uses the left lens for the telescopic feature. Because movies are non-canon, it is unknown whether Conan's glasses have this modification on both lenses in conjunction with the criminal tracking feature, or if one modification would instead interfere with the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was never stated when Agasa updated the lenses, and there is only a few appearances.

</answer></question><question Id="32328" Title="Does Nausica&#228; wear underpants, and if not, what outside-universe reason is there?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I haven't watched all of it yet, but it seems as if Nausica&#228; isn't wearing underpants in the anime version. Either that, or she's wearing tight-fitting slacks that are of a colour close to skin tone. Is she wearing underpants?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If she isn't wearing underpants, what is the outside-universe reason for not doing so? Within-universe, it seems to make sense: a lot of the clothing worn is very simple clothing, as if it were hand-made. However, while other Ghibli works I've come across seem moderately relaxed with regards to clothing (you can briefly see totally innocent underwear in Kiki's delivery service, and there's a joking suggestion of nude portraiture) it seems a little surprising. Is a bias against prudishness a shared theme of Ghibli, along with a love of flying and a love of nature?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/nausicaa/faq.html#bottom&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; (cited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_(character)#cite_ref-54&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) denies that any scenes were cut because of nudity, and states that the impression she doesn't wear underpants were because of poor quality videotape fansubs, saying that watching the DVD would clear it up - but I was watching the DVD to start off with. It also has some cover art from a manga version (not the anime) with white-coloured slacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="32340">&lt;p&gt;We don't actually know if Nausicaa wears underwear, but no, I do not believe we're staring at her naked bottom throughout the entire movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the manga covers, you can see pretty clearly that she's wearing white pants under her skirt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n7yR2l.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n7yR2l.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is the manga the original work that the movie was based on, it was written and drawn by Hayao Miyazaki himself. (It's right there on the cover&#8212;story and art by Hayao Miyazaki. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(manga)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; also confirms.) I don't know why he would have changed that between the manga release and the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I won't deny that her pants in the anime are cream-colored and seem to be tighter fitting, which definitely makes it look like she's not wearing anything under her skirt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEfUQ.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEfUQ.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen the DVD release and can also attest that this is the same in the DVD. According to &lt;a href="http://from-the-sidelines.blogspot.com/2013/04/nausicaa-of-valley-of-wind-1984.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt;, it's actually the Blu-ray release that cleans up the colors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having never acquired the DVD release of Nausica&#228; due to it being a low priority. The faded quality of the version I first saw years ago probably had a lot to do with it. In 2011, Disney released the Blu-ray and last year I decided to fill a gap in my collection. That turned out to be a great decision.  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s first Studio Ghibli Blu-ray release includes the movie on DVD and is of the digitally restored version. Suffice it to say this is the best the movie has ever looked in the States. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen in 1.85:1 ratio for both discs while the Blu-ray is in 1080p High Definition.    &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is absolutely gorgeous with the colors finally being faithful. This is important due to prior releases making it look like Nausica&#228; wasn&#8217;t wearing any pants or underwear! The color of her pants were too close to the skin tone used and got lost in the mastering before this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asianblurayguide.com/capture/1707/nausicaa_of_the_valley_of_the_wind_anime_japan/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a gallery of images from the Blu-ray release. We can see that, while the pants are still not as white as in the manga, they are definitely a different shade from her face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKOfr.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKOfr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say that Ghibli films have "a bias against prudishness". They'll show underwear or a bath scene if it makes sense to show it, but by anime standards, they're quite sparing with nudity and sexual themes. Miyazaki himself is usually considered a feminist; &lt;a href="https://bitchmedia.org/post/feminism-miyazaki-and-spirited-away-movie-princess-mononoke" rel="noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is one of many articles I found praising the feminist themes in his work. Even without all the other evidence, it just doesn't feel in character for Miyazaki to draw a heroine with no pants and no underwear running around exposing her naked rear end through an entire movie. So even if all we had was the DVD release and didn't have the Blu-ray or manga to suggest it to us, my vote would still go to "no, she's wearing pants".&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37737">&lt;p&gt;I watched it for the first time a few days ago and it never occurred to me that she wouldn't be wearing anything. It's rather clear that she's wearing either pants or leggings.

</answer></question><question Id="34048" Title="Was Picollo/Kami a special case of Namekian Fusion or this could be done by anyone?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I asked this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/32320/can-the-kai-earingspotara-earings-be-used-again-and-again-to-keep-fusing-indiv&quot;&gt;Potara fusion limit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In DBZ, we see Picollo fuse with Nail and exponentially increased his power. Then again he fused with Kami to further enhance this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was only Picollo/Kami able to do this type of fusion? I mean if you're on the verge of Genocide, you'd think some of the warriors may try fusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So was this due to knowledge (Nail new from the old Namek, Kami cos he divided his body) or physical limit of Namekians. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Associated, how many times could this be done?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34050">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was Picollo/Kami a special case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, Picollo didn't even know about the fusion and it was Nail who informed him how it works. That means it's limited to Namekians race and any two Namekian can do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many times could this be done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows it happen twice in anime series and it's still running, so future might tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Namekian_Fusion" rel="nofollow"&gt;dragonball.wikia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is more of an assimilation (the alternate title of this type of fusion) than fusion, as one Namekian absorbs the energy, strength, memories, and intelligence or thought pattern of another. Both participants must willingly consent to fuse in this manner and usually the pair agrees to the stronger of the two to serve their body as the host; the reason for this consent is that the body of the absorbed Namekian disappears during this fusion and the consciousness ceases to exist as a body. The agreed host places his hand over the chest of the other one and through unknown thoughts, a flash merges them. After the fusion, the non-host's consciousness lives inside the body of the host from this point onwards and their life span as a body ends. The host's consciousness dominates the body, while the non-host serves to aid him by supplying information, thereby meaning that the absorbed consciousness remains separate from the host's. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The largest difference with this type is that once fused it cannot be undone even by methods that can undo Potara fusions (such as being absorbed inside Buu, evidenced by the fact that Piccolo was found in Super Buu's body, but not Nail or Kami). Both the host and his partner maintain separate consciousnesses: while the host has control of the body, the partner can watch from inside and is capable of speaking with the host's consent; during his fight with Imperfect Cell, Piccolo gives Kami credit for coming up with the idea of playing possum in order to extract information from Cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35622">&lt;p&gt;Ankit is actually incorrect about this. The fusion between Kami and Piccolo was indeed special. Nail clarifies that Namekian fusion is only possible between two Warrior Namekians when he says he's the only Warrior Namekian on Namek apart from Piccolo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kami is of the Dragon Scion Namekians, the ones that can creat dragon balls and are generally weaker than their warrior type counterparts. The fusion between Kami and Piccolo is a special one because they were originally one Namekian. Thus allowing them to fuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal Namekian fusion can be done for as many Warrior Namekians there are. But the manga establishes that Nail was the only Warrior type on Namek. Probably because Guru worried about the preservation of his race so he mostly made Dragon types as they are the only type that can produce eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough the guidebooks go against the manga as there is more Warrior types than just Nail.&lt;/p&gt;

So my guess is the 14th Noah, Nea, is the reincarnation of the 1st Millenium Earl, the one that was killed by the other Noah, and for that reason he came back in another form as the 14th so he can kill the Millenium Earl and take his place back as head of the family.
Really silly answer, just guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14774">&lt;p&gt;It could be possible that the Millennium Earl was trying to hide the existence of the 14th Noah from the others for as long as possible, as until they found out about Allen, I don't recall any of them mentioning anything about the 14th, and they couldn't sense him yet as he wasn't awakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's always possible that it could've been an error in translation, but I doubt it, as the official versions are, well, official.&lt;/p&gt;

Why is Illumi's hair long?" Body="&lt;p&gt;So I have seen, and understood how Gon would have to train for such a long time frame to have his hair be that long. But, Illumi also has long flowing hair. Does this mean that Illumi has done something similar? Or maybe has Illumi just had a ton of bloodlust? and his hair went straight up?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODhvs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODhvs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46659">&lt;p&gt;It has been a while but I will try to answer with respect to the discussions held during that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I would like to point a golden rule: &lt;strong&gt;Correlation doesn't imply causation.&lt;/strong&gt; If Adult Gon and Illumi both have long hair it is &lt;em&gt;NOT necessary&lt;/em&gt; they have it for the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B1Ip4.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B1Ip4.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illumi has long hair because his &lt;strong&gt;character design&lt;/strong&gt; was meant to be that way. He was meant to be introduced as a very creepy, gender-fluid character who could easily dominate the "imperturbable" Killua. The hair design gave author to do a lot of things with Illumi.
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s88Md.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s88Md.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've arrived at the reason for Gon's hair being long correctly, I believe. During Gon's transformation into what Killua considers "How he would appear after years, if not decades, of training", we also notice that his hair has grown absurdly long. This implies how much of time he would need to spend training to improve his Nen Ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end with this is an old image with Illumi's character design (Hair). I'm not sure what does the Japanese text says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt;
Please Note, I know this answer is &lt;strong&gt;very opinionated&lt;/strong&gt; without author notes to back it up. It is drawn from discussions during the original manga release which I have not tracked. In this case its the best answer to the question I could think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to suggest ways to improve or any flaws in the train of thought, I might have missed. I also haven't followed HxH in a long time so any new information is very helpful. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47877">&lt;p&gt;For Illumi, I think he just let it long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gon's case, I have a theory for that. When Gon was learning about nen with Killua, their teacher (I forgot his name) said that the nen is an energy that not used just for fighting; the body cells use it to reproduce. It's an energy that can also be used by the body to grow. That's why there's some nen channels that allow just an amount for the person to use, so some energy can be stored for the body to use to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when Gon was fighting Neferpitou, he became angry, making him careless about what would happen for him if he could get revenge from her. He said to Killua to not worry because he didn't care anymore about his life if that meant she's gonna die (that scene with black and white). So he made a deal with himself to use all his nen, breaking those channels, and thus all the body parts and cells got a lot of energy, making them grown so fast. That's what happened to his muscles, they got bigger and bigger, his hair got longer than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(PS: I don't read the manga.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49449">&lt;p&gt;illumis hair is naturally long 
for gon he wanted stronger nen power to defeat pitou so he put a nen restriction to lose his nen to gain gain strength to beat her so his nen made his body grow into an adult so even his hair grew to that many years also thats why its so long like it hasnt been cut for so many years&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="55563">&lt;p&gt;A transformed gon would be around his 30's since decades of training could mean more then one decade meaning he could have been aged 20+ or 30+ years but he looked young so i don't think he was in his 40's meaning its simply what gon would look like in a 20+ time skip with out cutting his hair and i assume gon is 35 years old when he transformed since he was 14-15 by the end of the ark. Ya'll are overthinking it but,the designed could have been given to him because Hair symbolizes physical strength and virility; the virtues and properties of a person are said to be concentrated In some circles long hair on men is seen as a symbol of power and freedom if you ask me gon fit all this examples,As when he fought nerferpitou he was concentrated and he was also free as he did not care about his nen or life only revenging kite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Korra became the first Avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31515">&lt;p&gt;Actual Avatar reincarnation means Raava accepts part of current Avatar soul, leaves its body, and finds new Avatar. Communication with previous Avatar incarnations was exactly communication with parts of their souls inside Raava. Since Raava got itself destroyed, and then resurrected, it is in "clear" state, without souls of previous incarnations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Raava exists in this world, it can find new vessel to become next Avatar incarnation. The only consequence of its temporary destruction is that Korra is now much like Wan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the pamphlet included in the Elfen Lied OST, the melody of Lilium just surfaced to MOKA, the two-person musician group who was appointed the music producer staff of the Elfen Lied anime TV production team, when they looked at Elfen Lied from a certain perspective: it's not that Lucy wants to be born special &#8212; what she desires, the mundane happiness, that which appears to be easily obtainable is in fact obtainable by only a small handful of people.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;So in fate stay night Saber her Noble Phantom is called &quot;Excalibur&quot; which is the same name as her sword. But when Shiro trace the Excalibur, it turns out that is the one that Saber lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my question is, did King Arthur in History own two sword called Excalibur and Calibur?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="15118">&lt;p&gt;First, there is no "history" to speak of, as the tale of Arthur and Excalibur is fictional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, after looking at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur" rel="nofollow"&gt;Excalibur article&lt;/a&gt; on wikipedia, it appears that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sword in the Stone is the sword that proves Arthur's right to rule after Uther Pendragon;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caliburn is always an alternate name for Excalibur;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot-Grail" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vulgate Cycle&lt;/a&gt; (A 13th-century set of poems in french), Excalibur is explicitly identified as the Sword in the Stone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Vulgate_Cycle" rel="nofollow"&gt;Post-Vulgate Cycle&lt;/a&gt; (A revision of the Vulgate Cycle, with a lot of changes), Excalibur is the sword given by the Lady of the Lake, and was returned to her after Arthur's passing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Malory later compiled a number of Arthurian legends in his 1485 compilation called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur" rel="nofollow"&gt;Le Morte D'Arthur&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he mentions both versions of Excalibur's origin. Thomas Malory's work has been the main source for many modern Arthurian authors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Excalibur is the Sword in the Stone in some versions of the story, and in other versions it is not. In Fate/Stay Night, the latter option was chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the act of using the name "Caliburn" for a sword distinct from "Excalibur" seems uncommon. I suspect however that it is done so that it can be referred to by name instead of always having to call it "The Sword in the Stone". &lt;/p&gt;

The girls didn't have fairies to protect them, so they could and often did get hurt. They also didn't have the sealing ritual or Mankai at first either, so in the early battles they had no way to kill a vertex; the best possible outcome was to drive it off without any of them sustaining any serious injuries, but they weren't always that lucky. Gin died protecting the other two girls after they had both been injured in a battle, but for the full story (which is both heroic and sad) you really should read the light novel - it's a good book, and answers several questions that were left open by the anime. All of the chapters have been fan-translated into English and posted online.&lt;/p&gt;

  Bastion. Being told by the Princesses of Heart of the power that they
  sensed while on his way to seal the world's Keyhole, Sora, Donald,
  Goofy, and Beast go to the abandoned area where they fought Maleficent
  to investigate, and soon encounter Xemnas. Intangible at first, Xemnas
  passes through Sora, causing him to experience many of his memories in
  rapid succession, before fully manifesting. Sora asks who the man is,
  and Goofy wonders if it is Ansem, and though Xemnas says he is
  familiar with the name, he refuses to clarify his identity. He then
  launches an energy attack at Sora, who manages to deflect it (with
  some difficulty). Xemnas remarks how Sora looks like "him" and thus an
  incomplete being, his words only confusing Sora. Xemnas then attacks
  the Keyblade wielder, intending to test his power.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="53475">&lt;p&gt;In reply to Chrono D:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, Qrow and Raven Branwen are based off of Odin's twin Ravens, Hugin and Munin. Scarecrow will most likely be the Vacuo headmaster, as Lionheart, the Minstral headmaster, was based off the Cowardly Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a theory that team RWBY double as versions of Dorothy and her companions as well (weiss as the tin man, blake as the cowardly lion, and yang as the scarecrow). The difference is the headmaster's weve seen so far were them without what they searched for, while weiss blake and yang have found their heart, courage, and brains by journeying with Ruby. The headmasters likely had no "Dorothy" to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="49523" Title="How is the title of Yonko earned?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The Emperors of the sea Aka &quot;Yonkos&quot; are the 4 great pirates who are renowned and feared by both the masses and the world government. Rumors depict them to be so powerful and important that a loss/death of any, could have a ripple effect strong enough to destroy the authoritative order of some regions. Sadly enough, the Bounties of these Yonko are also unknown.&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AgiT5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AgiT5.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I'm trying to understand is how a pirate actually attains such a level; is it in any way related to the actual bounty of that individual or their second in command?  we all know that Kaido and big mom had subbordinates who attained bounties roughly around 1 billion; is that the prerequisite for becoming a Yonko? But then if that were the case, it doesn't explain how Marshal D teech was able to slyly slip into the ranks of Yonko.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or is it more about who is closest to becoming the pirate King? Or more like whoever can defeat a Yonko automatically snatches the title?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I ask this mainly because of a lot of theories floating around about luffy becoming the 5th Yonko;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; After luffy crashes Big Moms wedding and made it out alive, &quot;Big news Morgan&quot;   announces him as the 5th Emperor of the sea and that really confuses me; Is all it takes to become an Emperor an announcement from a media outlet?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My question is on how a pirate becomes known as a Yonko&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is there a deeper meaning to the title itself?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Extra Question lol: what did Blackbeard do differently from Trafalga law to become a Yonko?, after all they were both warlords for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49533">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yonko" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Yonko&lt;/a&gt; is not an official title that has specific criteria, but rather is one that is attached to extremely powerful and notorious pirates. There is no deep meaning to the title that has been revealed so far, but it does go beyond simply having amazing combat prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the Yonkos we've been introduced to so far, we can see three distinct traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;own abilities&lt;/strong&gt; are top notch. We've seen them possess immense strength and durability, have great control over Haki and most also possess strong Devil Fruit powers. They are among the top pirates even individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have &lt;strong&gt;fleets&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of their strength is attributed to these large fleets that ally with the Yonko. You can see the exact known stats in the link above, we've seen Whitebeard, Big Mom and Kaido to have huge crews. Each of the Yonkos will have a number of Commanders under them, who in turn have groups of mid-level pirate crews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have &lt;strong&gt;territory&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to their influence as a Yonko. They can declare locations as their own, and pirates and Marines can only bend to their will. The people residing in these territories are under the protection of the respective Yonko, and intruders are hunted down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yonko are not a group like the Shichibukai, and each have their own agendas. Whitebeard was not interested in finding the One Piece and becoming Pirate King, whereas Blackbeard and Big Mom are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they are the pirates with the best chances to become Pirate King thanks to this much power and influence, the relation between the two titles isn't very strong or clear yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as we can see, the determination of who is a Yonko is also largely dependent on how notorious they are and how the other entities view them. In Luffy's case, Morgan simply hypes it up in order to make his news more entertaining. The media is not the deciding body for who is and isn't a Yonko, but it certainly shapes public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reactions of the current Yonkos when shown, clearly indicate that they consider Luffy nowhere close to their level. Many fans would also agree to this conclusion, especially after&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; his fight with Kaido in the latest chapter of the Wano arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for the differences between Law and Teach, I'll also throw Luffy into the mix and explain. Being a Shichibukai has nothing to do with Yonko, it is not a required step. Law doesn't have a fleet, and only has an alliance with the Strawhats. And while he is powerful, he isn't exceptionally so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Blackbeard &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; killed Whitebeard during the Marineford war, and took his powers, becoming the first person to have two DF abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war, he quickly expands his fleet and takes over almost all of Whitebeard's territories. All of this together is what allowed him to be recognized as a Yonko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare Luffy against these metrics, we know that he has formed the Grand Strawhat Fleet at the end of the Dressarosa arc (though he doesn't seem to assign it much value right now). We also have confirmation from Oda that the fleet will play a huge role in the future. In addition, when it comes to territories, Luffy has challenged Big Mom over Fishman Island, which was initially under Whitebeard, and he is currently challenging Kaido for Wano. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While he may still be too much of a greenhorn to be a proper Yonko, he is definitely on the path to become one, which is why there are some proper backers (among fans), and his title as the 5th Yonko isn't being dismissed completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the difference is intent, the intent being to extend someone's life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the god of death decides to use the Death Note to kill the assassin of an individual he favors, the individual's life will be extended, but the god of death will die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a god of death intentionally does the above manipulation to effectively lengthen a human's life span, the god of death will die, but even if a human does the same, the human will not die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when Shinigami kill normally they will always affect people's livespans however if their intent is to extend a human's life then they are going against their very purpose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shinigami can also save other humans they care about if that person is about to die; however, the purpose of a Shinigami is to end life, not to give it. Any Shinigami who goes against this will be killed&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 55 of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Super&lt;/em&gt;, when Goku meets with the King of All towards the end, Goku lifted him up and down and he said, &quot;No one else can do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean Goku was special or just that the King of All would usually just wipe them out of existence?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36105">&lt;p&gt;I think it's just due to the fact that everyone else fears the King of All because he can wipe out the universes that people are too afraid to approach him casually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Goku is the only one who can do it because Goku's personality makes him extremely bold and un-phased when dealing with beings which could wipe him or anyone else out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="7387" Title="How are Higurashi and Umineko related?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I haven't watched Higurashi and am a bit hesitant to do so after seeing some clips of it and I haven't gotten around to watching Umineko but I've been wondering: apart from the obvious in how they have the alias &quot;When They Cry #&quot;, how are Higurashi and Umineko related?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;VNDB does not list any of the 4 visual novels as sharing any characters with each other than &lt;a href=&quot;http://vndb.org/v68&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://vndb.org/v2153&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru&lt;/a&gt; sharing characters from the unofficial &lt;a href=&quot;http://vndb.org/v12703&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Minagoroshi-hen Bad End ~Rika-hen~&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7402">&lt;p&gt;Higurashi and Umineko take place in the same story universe as far as I'm aware, but there is no character overlap. As of Umineko, there is an entirely new cast of characters. That said, events in Umineko may shed some light on the workings of the Higurashi / Umineko universe, and it references Higurashi quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not strictly necessary, I think you would get more out of Umineko if you watched Higurashi first, even though the cast and story is entirely different. Also, if you can manage, I'd recommend reading the Visual Novels for Umineko instead of watching the anime. The anime is poorly done and ends prematurely, leaving you with far too many questions unanswered and no real resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="13552" Title="How much content is required at minimum for a manga to get anime adaptation?" Body="&lt;p&gt;How many chapters or volumes of manga is required at minimum for a manga to get anime adaptation once the decision is made?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mean some animes start airing while their manga is still being released and sometimes the amount of material only suffices for a 12-13 episode season only.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Others wait and get adapted to make a 26-52 episode season of an anime. Who takes that decision to say &quot;OK! Let's make that an anime NOW!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To make it somewhat clearer, I'm asking about the length of the manga it takes to be adapted to an anime. Even if a decision was made to convert a manga to an anime there is still that point in time that they say &quot;ok. we now have enough material for a season&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The duplicate question asks in general what it takes for a manga to adapted in anime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13648">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How many chapters or volumes of manga is required at minimum for a manga to get anime adaptation once the decision is made?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer is none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long answer is: Anime adaptations can be in the &lt;em&gt;same universe&lt;/em&gt;, with different characters and plot without following the original material at all, so the reason that "there isn't enough chapters for a season" becomes moot. That's why is called an "adaptation" instead of "illustration".&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13658">&lt;p&gt;I think the correct answer is 'at least one page'. (because if it was zero, it wouldn't be a manga adaptation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no set limit on how much content one must have in order to get an adaption. The deciding factor is instead decided by the production company, sponsors and any other involved parties that make up the committee who decide which animations to produce. It does help the management board decide on a series if it the series has significant existing fan interest from the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while I can't think of any one-page manga that have been adapted, it is perfectly possible if the committee agrees to it - There will just be more effort put into planning around this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://washiblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/anime-production-detailed-guide-to-how-anime-is-made-and-the-talent-behind-it/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This blog post explains further about the anime production process&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This process depends on who&#8217;s pushing for an idea and who is backing it up, it can be animation studios themselves along with sponsors, but many anime are adaptations of manga or light novels, in which case, publishers front costs (including the costs of having it shown on TV stations). The production company (e.g Aniplex) gathers staff, sponsors, and looks at advertisement and merchandise. While many people describe studios as being cheap, only around half the budget is often given to the anime studio, with the rest going to broadcasters and other contributing companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worthy of note that many mangas themselves are adaptations from light novels or visual novels or may have other spin-off content which adds to the content that the studios can work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content range of which adaptations do come to life can vary significantly. This is to do with chapter sizes, author preference, committee requests, etc. Every show will have different requirements and differing ease of adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example; &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=595393" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chihayafuru&lt;/a&gt;'s first season (of 13 episodes) covers 40 chapters &amp;amp; Claymore with 22 episodes covers roughly 60. Hikari lychee club is a manga adaption, but is very different in style and story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/519Sbm.png" alt="cute :)"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr2W0m.jpg" alt="not cute D:"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably a bit of a disappointing answer, but there is no minimal content requirement and it is something that differs from company to company.&lt;/p&gt;

She always listened with her right ear. But then one day, she woke up to find that her right ear had gone deaf. She tried to keep it a secret, but the boy accidentally put on really loud music, and because she couldn't hear, she wasn't surprised or anything, and that was where he realized.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One day, the girl went to her part time job in a shop and someone placed their order.

After that, he confronted the girl about why she didn't tell him about her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it was a pretty modern art style.

Is that some quality of the fishmen or am I missing something?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the image from the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qoQTr.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7023">&lt;p&gt;Well if you think of it in a real life standpoint, the air is full of water particles, gather tons of it together and I suppose you can do something like that xD.

</answer></question><question Id="48152" Title="Why did Gohan not use the multiform technique during the Saiyaman saga?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Videl runs off to fight crime. Gohan runs to the bathroom, preforms the multiform technique, and 1/2 of his power gets to go and back her up while the other 1/2 goes back to class. As Saiyaman he probably never used more than a hundredth of his power, so a 50% handicap wouldn&#8217;t have hurt anything. Heck, he could have maintained his golden fighter identity and just made sure to let Videl (and anyone else) see both him and the gold fighter side by side to secure an iron clad alibi. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m not sure if he ever used the technique himself, but I know he saw his Dad use it during the Cell games and I&#8217;m pretty sure he knew about it before that from Krillin. Instead of flying to Bulls for the costume after his first day, he could have flown to Kane house and asked Krillin to teach him the move &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know that the real answer is &#8216;because it would have broken the plot&#8217;. I&#8217;m looking for a believable in universe reason. I don&#8217;t buy that he wouldn&#8217;t have thought about it, he&#8217;s a genius. Why didn&#8217;t Gohan use the multiform technique during the Saiyaman saga?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48154">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You make a lot of interesting assumptions. Before I explain why this wouldn't have been feasible for reasons other than &lt;i&gt;"because it would have broken the plot"&lt;/i&gt;, I would like to make three corrections with regard to some of the facts you stated. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The technique Krillin uses is called the &lt;b&gt;Triform&lt;/b&gt;. Picollo and he use this technique against Nappa in the Saiyan Saga. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also, Goku never uses the Multiform technique against Cell, it was Cell &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_ZBrw6bFhU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;who uses it against him&lt;/a&gt;. Goku is a character who is very strongly against the usage of this technique. He was the first character who pointed out its flaw.&lt;li&gt;Finally, it's too much of a stretch to call &lt;i&gt;Gohan&lt;/i&gt; a "&lt;i&gt;Genius"&lt;/i&gt;. You could consider him to be well educated and smart. He definitely isn't the combat genius his father is and his intellect cannot be compared to someone like Bulma's. It is also important to note that Gohan never came up with the idea of the suit. He consulted the smartest person he knows with regard to his identity issue and it was a suggestion of Bulma's as you see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyHLqgnl1ss" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now with regard to why this wouldn't have worked&lt;li&gt;The Cloning procedure can only be of 2 possibilities. The first possibility is that there is one Main Clone which acts as the brain for even the remaining clones. The second possibility is that every clone is its own being and thinks and acts on its own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case of the first scenario,  it wouldn't work for obvious reasons as Gohan would have control over his clone and he obviously cannot be present in class and be able to assess the situation outside and have his clone act our accordingly and fight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case of the second scenario, how exactly would Gohan have control of his other clones and be able to destroy them when neccesary. He would have no way of communicating with his clones and it more or less would decrease Gohans power almost permanantly. If Gohan did have the ability to control the rest of his clones, it would end up being the first scenario.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the above explanation, you see that the multiform/triform technique, cannot really be used to perform multiple activities at different locations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if he were to use the multiform technique, He would still require the Great Saiyaman outfit or any outfit for that matter to disguise himself outside. Even if he happens to be in class when his clone is out fighting crime, the press would still be able to to get a picture of his clone or someone would easily spot him. &lt;li&gt;Based on your logic, even if Gohan had his clone right next to him, &lt;i&gt;"to establish an alibi"&lt;/i&gt;, wouldn't Videl and everyone else still be suspicious as to how there exists a fighter who looks exactly like him? The Great Saiyaman's identity would have to be revealed at some point. If his identity was never to be revealed, then Videl wouldn't have known it was Gohan even without using the clones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While Gohan didn't really want to reveal his identity, I really don't think he cared to the extreme extent you think, to try so hard to establish an alibi. In the Martial Arts tournament, while he was embarassed about his identity being revealed, he didn't care that much to try to fled the scene immediately. He also had no problem transforming into Super Saiyan in front of everybody to fight Kibito when he had to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ultimately, Clone or No Clone, a disguise would have been necessary. A regular outfit would have been too much of a hassle to change out of, hence, Bulma. Gohan did the smartest thing he could do by consulting the Most Intelligent person he knew. The Saiyaman outfit(and the convenience to switch into the same), was realistically the best possible solution. Although, the design and Gohan's supposed Superhero Persona while wearing the same are indeed questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="20882">&lt;p&gt;Beedrill is called Poison Bee Pokemon, but Kingdra is called Dragon Pokemon when it's clearly a seahorse. I'd say it's based off a wasp, due to the fact that its main feature is a sting. Bees sting once then die, but wasps can sting as many times as they want, just like Beedrill. Hence the 3 stingers.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;During Chapter 5: Absolute Despair Girls in Danganronpa: Ultra Despair girls, we get to visit Jatoro's room.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I noticed a painting there that seemed like it could be a reference or an existing work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQfvs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQfvs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this an original painting, or is it an existing work - or a reference to one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="25885">&lt;p&gt;This is a take on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woman with a Parasol, turned to the left&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by painter Claude Monet. Although in this version the woman has pink hair - possibly referring to Junko Enoshima or Kotoko Utsugi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd say it's more likely to be Junko because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Firstly the hair length is similar to Junkos, Also Jataro confesses to Komaru and Toko that Junko was the only person who had ever shown him affection and love. It's also implied he has a childlike crush on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original painting is of Alice Hosched&#233;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; who was later to become Monet's wife. Possibly a desire of Jotaro's brought out in his painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was one of Monet's favourite models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who want to know the part that was not included in the anime, because in my opinion there is a big difference, it'd be good to read the original light novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review by &lt;a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/4317753/world-end-season-2-light-novel-sukasuka-sukamoka-spoilers-movie-worldend-what-do-ou-do-at-the-end-of-the-world/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Inquisitr&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;warning: the site included speculation to season 2's material&lt;/strong&gt;) stated,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overall, the anime adaptation of the &lt;em&gt;Suka Suka&lt;/em&gt; light novel is good and does not sacrifice pacing, although various scenes were rearranged and shortened. Anime usually has to skim over certain details and world building is discarded to fit the source material within 12 episodes. The biggest change from the light novel is that the anime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; neglects to reveal the true identity of the First Beast, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;but author Kareno probably retconned that spoiler from Volume 1 on purpose since it really didn't make sense to have that revelation so early. A certain beast is not introduced at all in the anime and this character is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;  critical to Volumes 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There's also little differences. For example, in World End Episode 11 the characters find a girl encased in crystal. [In the light novel...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Willem activates his "spell vision," an ability never used in the anime, to analyze the curse and the narrative gives more details about the hex's abilities. The book also has a long discussion between him and Grick about the state of the girl and whether it&#8217;s possible to resurrect her like what was done with Willem. When Chtholly becomes entranced by the crystal, Willem literally has to plunge his hand into her chest, collapsing her lungs, in order to disrupt her magic flow and return her to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That's just one minor scene, &lt;strong&gt;which gives you an idea of how much content the anime skips over. As you can see, it's worth reading the light novels even if you've watched the anime&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Emphasis mine)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://jumpmagazinetabare.seesaa.net/article/449986857.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the Japanese's impressions on episode 6 (= end of volume 2)&lt;/a&gt; are more-or-less: those who have read the light novel were more emotionally moved than those who only watched the anime since the anime skipped a lot/the pace was too quick.&lt;/p&gt;

Based on the 2 &quot;gals&quot; in the show, and compared to the other girls in the show, it seems there's a marked difference in style, personality, and appearance to be labeled a &quot;gal&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is a &quot;gal&quot; in anime or Japanese culture?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41516">&lt;p&gt;"Gal" is the English transliteration for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyaru" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gyaru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fashion trend in Japanese culture.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tanning/darkening the skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wearing lots of shiny makeup (traditional Japanese culture is very modest with makeup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wearing lots of jewelry and has lots of accessories (fake nails, excessive nail/toe polish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectively, the "gals" in &lt;em&gt;My First Girlfriend is a Gal&lt;/em&gt; are following the &lt;em&gt;gyaru&lt;/em&gt; fashion trend.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41520">&lt;p&gt;Can't comment yet so I'll add an answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#12462;&#12515;&#12523; (&lt;em&gt;gyaru&lt;/em&gt;) is actually the way they imported the English word "girl". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they imported the English slang "gal" on top of that as a back-&lt;em&gt;Romaji&lt;/em&gt;-ized name for the current fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In addition to what Makoto said.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese is more complete and more interesting, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42318">&lt;p&gt;There is also a bit of a deeper meaning and as to why this trend came about. It goes way back to the World War 2 and a bit before. After occupation to make money, girls would well prostitute themselves, so a tanned girl was also a sign that they were out on the corner a lot. In the rebellion days of youth, in the 80s, it was a way to rebel in Asia, so it became a popular trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why you also get that "gals" are sluts or whores. In the west though, tanning became a positive thing while in the east it became a negative thing. Also why in the anime and the manga of &lt;em&gt;Hajimete no Gal&lt;/em&gt;, the ex calls her a "slut". Also, &lt;em&gt;Hajimete no Gal&lt;/em&gt; directly translates to "first time gal".&lt;/p&gt;

Am I correct in speculations?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Who really discovered why Lelouch had to die?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31213">&lt;p&gt;The only ones who seem to be in on the Zero Requiem plan were Suzaku, C.C. and Jeremiah.

</answer></question><question Id="13919" Title="What happened to Lupin?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Episode 3, after Death the Kid makes his appearance in front of Lupin, Kid &quot;senses&quot; Patty is off center and thus the formation is no longer symmetrical. As he complains about it to Liz, Patty watches Lupin escape though the manhole.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Lupin had a huge sack of Human Souls with him when he escaped, which is obviously a bad thing since devouring human souls allows one to gain power quicker but leads one down the path of being a Kishin. This would be something that can't be ignored by Death or the Overseeing Death Scythes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering, is it ever explained what happened to Lupin and the souls he stole after he escaped from Kid?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13922">&lt;p&gt;This is quite a downer of an answer, however there really is &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After escaping, within neither the anime nor manga, is Lupin mentioned again. I personally read Soul Eater and watched it, I don't recall any more sign of him, and this 'thesis' is backed up by the &lt;a href="http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Lupin" rel="nofollow"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debuts&lt;/strong&gt; - 
  Manga - &lt;em&gt;'Death the Kid'&lt;/em&gt;, 
  Anime - &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Boy. Death the Kid&#8217;s Magnificent Mission?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably assume, this is indeed Episode 3, which I trust is the appearance you are referring to (being his only). It mustn't have ended with such a bad fate, as the use of the human souls, as we probably would have heard about a new Kishin being born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt it, as I'm not following it, however there is a possibility his name is at least &lt;em&gt;mentioned&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Soul-eater Not!&lt;/strong&gt;, however I have yet to hear anything regarding that.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="23856" Title="What caused the difference between the good and true endings of Unlimited Blade Works?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In what is presumably the &quot;good ending&quot; of the Unlimited Blade Works route, Saber stays after the Grail is destroyed, because Rin has turned her into a familiar. (I also got the sense that Shiro was supposed to aid Rin in supplying prana to Saber by having sex with her.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, everything up to the end is identical to the path taken in the true ending, &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for the fact that Shiro spends more time bonding with Saber (and less with Rin) in the path to this ending. If so, why does Saber remain in one ending and not the other, given that:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything Rin did up to the end should have been identical in either outcome in UBW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saber should have disappeared (as stated before the final battle) with the destruction of the Grail. However, whether or not this statement about Saber is &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; correct may be slightly debatable, per content from the rest of the &lt;em&gt;Fate&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; In the true end of Heaven's Feel, Rider remains after the destruction of the Greater Grail, because Sakura still has a lot of prana on account of her being a copy of the Holy Grail vessel. In &lt;em&gt;Fate/Zero&lt;/em&gt;, we see Gilgamesh pull Kotomine out of the rubble, and in the Fate route, we learn that he has stayed around for the last ten years, partly by obtaining energy from the orphans of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did Rin just pull more strings to try to keep Saber, or did Saber have more reason to try to stay because of her connection to Shiro?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="24562">&lt;p&gt;The reason Saber stays in the good ending but not the true ending is specifically because of the love between Shiro and Arturia. Under Shiro's command, she has a strong reason to destroy the grail and also to claim the grail. While she may want to stay with Shiro, which not using up the command seals would allow, her desire for the grail and her desire to stay with Shiro would both strongly prevent her from destroying the grail, thus resulting in Shiro's use of the last command seal, releasing the summoning that maintains Saber. However in Unlimited Blade Works Saber is released from Shiro at one point and makes a pact with Rin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, following the path with Rin as her master and still focusing on her allows Saber to fall in love and have no opposing desires in relation to the Holy Grail. Falling in love with Shiro and becoming dedicated to its destruction for multiple good reasons throughout the UBW route means she's free to destroy it herself without any compelling action of any kind. No command seal needs to be used, so her summoning isn't canceled when its destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is based on logical thought on my part though: I've watched UBW and FSN, but they say the FSN anime is butchered and the UBW anime follows the conclusion to the true path. I've not seen the good ending for Unlimited Blade Works, I recently started through the Fate portion of &lt;em&gt;Fate/Stay Night&lt;/em&gt; and am working towards UBW, where I'll likely find the good ending before Heavens Feel.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36467">&lt;p&gt;In the visual novel nothing is told. 
The anime clarifies quite a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True ending: Rin stares as saber disappears (no running from Rin). After a while Saber starts her speech: Basically congratulations, I would have really liked to stay but Shiro has you (it is sooo clear she can be easily convinced, but Rin didn't do anything). In this ending it is also clear Rin is head over heels for Shirou and realises he doesn't care that much for saber. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ending: Rin runs like berserker to save saber (it's just a few meters though). Now the big question, Why did Rin saver her? There are 2 possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) She doesn't love Shiro that much since she didn't receive enough points. I would find it hard to believe though because of how much she insists afterwards he's hers and that saber and her will teach him magic and martial arts on a daily basis. Also, why get so angry then when she considers they're flirting? 
And why would Rin also say: You want her to stay, so it's alright (this is said in the VN). 
Another reason I don't think it's likely is because in the whole VN Rin always gives Shirou what he wants: Fate (she helps bringing saber and Shirou together); UBW (if you just want Rin, you get just Rin. If you're also interested in saber Rin runs to save her); HF (she wants him to be with Sakura and be happy).
You could argue it is because Rin doesn't love him a lot, but 90% of the time she's risking her life because of him (and dies a few times due to that in the bad endings). Sakura can't do that even if she wants to and saber does it out of her contract (at least during the first part of each route). I've always imagined Rin as Shirou's guardian angel, and the only reason they turn into a couple in UBW is because he realises that even before the war started she saved him by consuming her most powerful weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) She knows in this ending Shirou would almost die of sorrow if saber goes (not so much as the fate route but not that far away either). Well, this is what I believe happens. The reason why Rin keeps insisting saber is her familiar and hers would therefore be because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She doesn't want them to get romantically attached (in the VN she tells them not to flirt), she just wants saber to watch over him (so he doesn't become archer) and support him and make him happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine Rin gives saber back. Well, this would be a threesome whether they want it or not. Rin not having a link with saber = having sex with her, the same goes for Shirou. Now, with the link Shirou and Rin can become a couple and mana be supplied constantly without sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36492">&lt;p&gt;As someone who completely finished the Visual Novel (including the secret scene for viewing all the tiger dojos) I believe I am well qualified to say this: The difference is not clear. It could be said that Rin loved Shirou so much that she chose to keep Saber (at the cost of 80% of her reserves) it could also be said that she kept Saber for the prestige of having a Pseudo-Divine spirit as a familiar.  It could even be said that it was to give Saber a second chance at life. In the end it's up to the viewer to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36504">&lt;p&gt;Kyle mohr, I read everything as well (Fate VN, fate hollow and anime =P) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning of my last post, the VN clarifies very little. Even so there's some evidence to defend my point of view (which I stated in my previous post). Something I didn't mention before but is quite relevant is that Rin either subsconciously or conciously chooses Archer (Shirou) over Saber. She asks Archer to remain in this world and cries when he doesn't accept. This happens in both the good and true ending (right before the good ending would come archer's scene). I think that if Archer had accepted Rin's proposal, both the true and happy endings would be the same (Rin - Shirou - Shirou). I do believe in the good ending, Rin runs to save Saber because of how much Shirou cares for her (at least 4 points given to her). Even so by asking Archer to stay afterwards Saber would have left this world had Archer accepted. (There's not enough mana for both of them and Rin knows it. She also knows Saber isn't selfish to stay that way. By asking Archer she's in a way betraying Saber, that's why she thinks "I know I shouldn't ask", even though she asks, and Archer says "I do not know if you will keep your contract with Saber, but I am not qualified for that.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, I guess if you really push it, it could also be said she does it for selfish reasons. (You mentioned "It could also be said that she kept Saber for the prestige of having a Pseudo-Divine spirit as a familiar.")
Well, that is a possibility: maybe she wants a powerful servant and she just happens to find Archer more adequate to her needs.
She may also want a harem and 2 Shirous are better than one so she's saying to Saber: I really wanted to give you a second chance in life but since I'd have to monitor your every move (cause you're into Shirou...) I'd much rather give that second chance to Archer and have 2 boys head over heels for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only clear thing is that Rin prioritizes Shirou and Archer. (Even after his betrayal, which almost kills her at some point, her mind is 100% set in making Archer live with her no matter how many VN points she is assigned from Shirou. This shows how much she cares for Shirou. After all she does say at some point in the VN: "it doesn't matter if he betrayed me, Archer is Shirou.")&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36507">&lt;p&gt;It was to make him happy. Just watch this video (minutes 9-16) in which future Rin talks to present Rin in fate hollow ataraxia. At some point future Rin says: Rather than becoming happy together, I will, with no questions asked, and more than anyone else, give him happiness.

In the good ending Shirou's happiness depends a lot on saber staying, that's why Rin does all she can to make her stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What word does define Rin?: Tsundere that hides her feelings and pretends to act out of selfishness. I will translate her tsundere words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirou asks Rin: Why did you keep her? Rin asnwers: Because she is the most powerful servant.
Translation: "I did it for you" (because otherwise it doesn't make sense that in the true ending she doesn't keep saber or how much she implores archer to stay as her servant when there's not enough prana for 2 servants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rin says: ""Saber is mine and so are you"
Translation: You are MINE and I'd suffer a thousand deaths before giving you saber back so that you can fuck her every day (Because that's how bad Shirou is as a mage. Unlike Rin, Shirou supplies magical energy by fucking. A link is never created, it is just endless fucking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rin says: "I'll need you to help me supply saber. I won't be as bad as saber but I'll still be an inconvenience"; "I'll supply saber with magical energy and you will give me a boost"
Translation: Keep your hands off Saber, you horny dog! Eh? You can't hold it? Hmph, i-it can't be helped. I will l-let you do me, OK? It's not like I want to f-fuck or anything, baka! I just need mana for Saber!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily future Rin leaves the tsun part and becomes a love-struck caring wife that doesn't conceal her feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36748">&lt;p&gt;True End: Saber drew her conclusion from watching Shirou's conflict with Archer and gives up the Holy Grail. Although its not the "perfect" end like Fate, she still managed to find her answer. She knows that Rin will make Shirou happy and keep him hinged to reality, so she peacefully sever her contract with Rin and disappear (as all 3 Command Seals at that point are used)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good End: Due to the increased affection between Saber and Shirou, she decided she wanted to watch over him and Rin. Rin decide not to cut the contract, partially because she wanted Shirou to be happy, partially because she wanted Saber to be happy (from Fate route Boy meets Girl meets Girl, Rin is a confirmed bisexual and is attracted to Saber).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Good End is Rin's harem essentially&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38155">&lt;p&gt;The difference lies in the way Shirou distributes his affection points.&lt;br&gt;
In the good ending Shirou gives Saber a certain number of them whereas in the true ending Shirou only wants Rin and doesn't pay attention to Saber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the best way to understand why Rin only brings her in the good ending is to know what she does in every route. My conclusion is that it was done for Shirou's sake.
If we start with the routes in which Shirou loves Saber we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fate route: At the beginning Rin doesn't want Shirou and Saber to be together. When Saber ran out of magi and was about to die Rin told Shirou she'll disappear as he can't give her mana. She was deliberately letting her die. After a while Shirou is taken by Illya. Rin goes to save him. There are a few times where Rin tells Shirou to abandon Saber as she's too weak to go on, but he doesn't, he carries her.
It isn't until they are all about to die that Rin says Mmm even if you're inexperienced and can't transfer mana through the master-servant pact you can sex her as your semen contains lots of magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he falls in love with Saber, Rin helps him get her. Rin helps Shirou plan Saber and Shirou's date. At the end Rin wasn't there to save Saber because she was at the Emiya house close to dying because of heavy injuries. Fortunately in the "last episode" we get Saber and Shirou's true happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlimited Blade Works Good Ending: Shirou gives Saber affection points and Rin brings her. They all live happily. Rin supplies mana through the master-servant link as she's an experienced magician. Shirou has to sex them as it is the only way he can supply magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fate Hollow Ataraxia: 6 months after some route Rin revives Saber and gives her to Shirou as he needs her. Shirou was so happy his eyes are watery and he can barely see. Because of different reasons there's no need to give her mana so this time Rin makes Shirou Saber's master as she's not needed to give her mana. By the end of the game he's still Saber's master. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routes in which Shirou doesn't love Saber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlimited Blade Works true ending: Shirou deliberatey focuses on Rin and doesn't pay attention to Saber. Rin doesn't bring her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heaven's Feel: Shirou wants Sakura. Saber becomes an obstacle. Rin supports Shirou against Saber/Dark Sakura in order to save Sakura, which leads to Saber dying and Shirou getting Sakura. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, by comparing what Rin does in every route regarding Saber I've come to the conclusion Rin only saves/resurrects... Saber when Shirou needs her and most times Rin won't even be with them. The closest Rin gets to Saber is UBW good ending where all 3 are living happily because Shirou loves Rin but at the same time he needs Saber.
The reason she becomes Saber's master in UBW is to save Shirou who was seconds from dying and at the end of the good ending she's the only one that can give her mana through a link and has enough mana to sustain her properly (though boosts are still needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the times Rin either hands Saber to Shirou even though she can have her (Ataraxia) or simply doesn't try to get her for her own gain.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="4106" Title="Why do Saber and Rin sound disappointed when they see inside Shiro's shed?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime (and also in the visual novel when you make the correct choice), Shiro walks out and overhears Rin and Saber talking. They sound disappointed (maybe even angry) about a discovery they make in the shed Shiro practices in when he does reinforcement on stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this in relation to his Unlimited Blade Works Reality Marble and how he has been unknowingly been doing something very wrong when he uses Reinforcement/Projection? Or, is there something else in that shed that Kiritsugu left, and never told Shiro about (like the Crest on the floor which activated when summoning Saber)?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4199">&lt;p&gt;Tohsaka is probably disappointed because the shed is like Shirou's workshop. Tohsaka is a professional magus; her workshop probably has magical items and books and scrolls, but Shirou has broken junk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe, it's the same for Saber (but we do not know if Saber knows what a workshop should be like).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="43213" Title="Why don't Vegeta and Goku not getting along most of the times?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I mean, after all, they grew up together and one might refer to them as &quot;brothers&quot; (though they are not biologically related), but why is Vegeta always so cruel towards Goku is the maybe underlying reason or story behind I am missing (history) it's just how he is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am aware that Vegeta might be extremely competitive at times. But does anyone really knows why the series producers decided to portrait Vegeta as a &quot;semi-villain&quot; or Goku's other enemy (if you may) or maybe something Goku might have done in the past to Vegeta?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They do have common enemies after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43217">&lt;p&gt;Vegeta and Goku have a very close relationship. I'd say they share a bond even stronger than what Goku share's with someone like Krillin. They might not be friends that hang out together, laugh and have a normal conversation but they see each other as source of motivation to help better themselves and become stronger, that makes them more ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might look as though Vegeta hates Goku but in reality, it's just his personality and the way he is which also brings a comedic aspect to the show. Vegeta has a very cocky and arrogant personality and also him being the Saiyan prince is responsible for the same. He considers his race to be superior to all other beings and he's the kind of guy who likes to assert his dominance over all other beings by using his power. Goku on the other hand, trains purely out of love for combat and doesn't share the same motivations as Vegeta which is one big difference between their personalities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vegeta always had a mutual respect for Goku but I recommend you watch the fight between Kid Buu and Goku where Vegeta acknowledges Goku's superiority and has a new found respect for him. Even in Dragon Ball Super, it might appear as though Vegeta doesn't like Goku but if Goku's life were at risk, Vegeta would step in and help him. This is seen when he catches Goku after Beerus knocked him out. Also when Freiza was about to kill him, Vegeta steps in. Even during the tournament of power, we see Vegeta step in to help Goku while he was being attacked by Universe 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple words, Vegeta is jealous of Goku's strength. He has admitted this a couple of times, although his arrogance and massive ego doesn't want him to accept him being weaker than another saiyan which is why we see him display some form of anger when he sees Goku and not cause he hates him.&lt;/p&gt;

I think they call it Super saiyan Berserk because in the Dragon Ball series, Goku and CO never meet Broly, so they have no idea about the green transformation. So they refer to the way Kale act when transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="818" Title="Why are tentacles prevalent in anime?" Body="&lt;p&gt;What is the reason/motivation for the prevalence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle_erotica&quot;&gt;tentacles&lt;/a&gt; (possibly NSFW Wikipedia link) in anime (esp. hentai)?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did the anime subculture lead to it or does it stem from various aspects (possibly obscure) of Japanese art/culture?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="819">&lt;p&gt;Toshio Maeda, the manga artist who did Urotsukidoji, one of the first shows to use tentacles, said in an interview that he &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2012-08-22/interview-toshio-maeda"&gt;used tentacles to circumvent the Japanese censorship laws which prohibit the depiction of male genitalia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why tentacles? For some reason there were some issues about censorship about the sex scenes. When I was drawing sex scenes, sensual scenes in bed, editors always asked me not to be so extreme. Of course we couldn't depict genitals, and if you can't see their genitals, it's not so good. And why they are so fussy about that was because they were the ones who would get arrested. We are not, always we have the freedom to express ourselves &#8211; freedom of speech, I think you really respect that in America (laughs). So actually we mangaka didn't give a shit about that, but the editors, they really cared about that, so they always said, &#8220;Please, not extreme.&#8221; But when we toned ourselves down, they said, &#8220;Come on, you should do more.&#8221; So that's why I did the tentacle thing. Because tentacles are not genitals. They are parts of the body, and some creatures have more than one. Because they are not genitals, they are like hands and legs or like uh, just body parts, so it's ok to go there. And attacking ladies with tentacles is not just part of a sex scene, you can see that. It's just outdoor things. So it was kind of a flimsy excuse for drawing that. (laughs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it caught on and is memetic in anime. It's phallic and can be used to imply something sexual, cue something "naughty", or even as fan service to poke fun at the culture. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4584">&lt;p&gt;Going one step over, here's the reason of the censorship, &lt;a href="http://www.toplessrobot.com/2013/06/10_things_i_learned_about_video_games_eroge_japan_and_myself_from_playing_saya_no_uta.php"&gt;according to this article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Bennett, one of the actions taken by Allied forces after
  World War II was to ban pornography in Japan. As Japan was a very
  sexual culture prior to the war, occupying forces blamed porn for the
  aggressive and expansionary tendencies of the Japanese Empire, and the
  ban was created to curb their combative nature. That being said, it's
  illegal for genitalia, real or animated, to be featured in
  entertainment; a ban that over sixty years later is still in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Going back to that damn Allied anti-porn law, penises and vaginas were
  parts non-grata in Japanese entertainment. But those meddling Yankees
  didn&#8217;t say a Cthulu-damned thing about tentacles. In fact, so long as
  it&#8217;s attached to a monster, it doesn&#8217;t count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://visualnovelaer.fuwanovel.org/2013/06/saya-no-uta-article-by-jason-helton-apparently-the-reason-for-censored-genitalia-is-because-of-the-us/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22631">&lt;p&gt;The other answers are also correct, but a significant player in the tentacle's popularity was the anime &lt;em&gt;Urotsukidoji - Legend of the Overfiend&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1987&lt;/strong&gt; which was one of the first hentai to feature tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it was so influential is that its sales were very good. Especially in the West, where it got a lot of media attention for its gore and rape scenes. Of course, this only drove more sales for the show. In Britain, it sold 40,000 copies at a time when the average convention was about 500 in attendance. For comparison, the only animated feature that sold more than this (by 1998 at least) was Akira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Ref: &lt;em&gt;Schoolgirl Milky Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trad&lt;/em&gt;e )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this show that started the term 'tentacle rape' and is also the source of early bad reputation for anime in Britain, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As hentai shows were quite new then (The first hentai anime d&#233;buted in 1984), the commercial success of the overfiend probably contributed heavily to it's future repeated use in erotic animation.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She never "eats" her element to power up, she only drinks water like normal people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not from any generation of Dragon Slayers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a first generation Dragon Slayer. She has never learn her Magic from an actual Dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a second generation Dragon Slayer. She has never had Dragon Lacrima implanted into her body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a third generation Dragon Slayer. She has never both learn her Magic from an actual Dragon and had Dragon Lacrima implanted into her body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a fourth generation Dragon Slayer. Not an artificial beings created from Dragon Lacrima. (From the movie)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of her skill something like "Roaring Magic".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of her magic use the word "Dragon" unlike all Dragon Slayers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never has seen to have motion sickness like Natsu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never has seen to have dragon scales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When fighting Dragons, her magic didn't have any effect on them. (the only magic that can hurt dragon is Dragon Slayer magic).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like I said in the comment, the premises is to have 7 dragon slayers in FT side and they are Natsu, Gajeel, Wendy, Laxus, Cobra, Sting and Rogue. There's no chance of an 8th Dragon Slayer. &lt;/li&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the latest chapters of the Naruto manga (673 and 674), why does Sasuke possess only one Rinnegan and not both?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8860">&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that he chose not to use the other one. With the Rinnegan not able to use Sharingan's abilities, it's probably better to use both at the same time. Madara was seen switching back and forth between the Rinnegan and Sharingan, so it should be something that Sasuke can do as well.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9549">&lt;p&gt;Maybe the other eye is only for Sharingan, or he can't have two Rinnegans because it might replace his Sharingan permanently. However, one thing is for sure: he might use Sharingan and Rinnegan at the same time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="11310">&lt;p&gt;Sasuke's Rinnegan is exactly the same Rinnegan of Kaguya's 3rd eye and Madara's 3rd eye. Since, Madara's 3rd eye and Kaguya's 3rd eye are one and the same, this means that there is only one such eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Rinnegan with Sharingan tomoe has always been a one eye case from the beginning. It is very different from Madara's Rinnegan, which is same as Hagoromo's pair of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="21448">&lt;p&gt;For starters: Sasuke's Rinnegan is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the same as Kaguya's/Madara's Rinne Sharingan (not to be confused with Madara's Rinnegan, I'm talking about the one in the middle of the forehead of both of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sasuke's Rinnegan has 6 tomoe, Rinne Sharingan has (at least) 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sasuke's Rinnegan is blue, Rinne Sharingan is red.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason Sasuke only has the Rinnegan in one eye was not mentioned or explained in either the series or the data book. So we can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no particular order, here are my speculations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hagoromo only gave Sasuke enough chakra to awaken the Rinnegan in one eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That's the best Sasuke can do without fusing Asura's chakra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's the cool factor.&lt;/li&gt;

Is this so? Is the Dragon Ball Super manga &quot;more faithful&quot; to Akira Toriyama ideas than the anime?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48110">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is incorrect. Toriyama has a lot of control with regard to the anime. An article &lt;a href="http://comicbook.com/anime/2017/11/10/dragon-ball-super-akira-toriyama-involvement-toei-changes/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; indicates, how 2 Dragon Ball Super executives reveal at an anime convention, as to how much control they have over Toriyama.  The staff often build upon his ideas. You can always read his original drafts for every arc and see that the majority of the story is built on his ideas and that staff often work around his main plot and add characters. Here is Toriyama's original draft of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herms98/status/972038504992587776" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Tournament of Power arc"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some interesting points:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you look at the preview of the Tournament of Power exhibition match, the character in the hood was initially supposed to be Jiren and not Toppo. However, Toriyama mentioned Jiren's backstory and said he was a character who didn't speak and then originated Toppo's character.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the Dragon Ball Super staff considered Broly's popularity and presented Kale's idea to Toriyama, he added Caulifla.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even the Ultra Instinct transformation was completely decided by Toriyama and he came up with the Perfected Ultra Instinct idea. So the idea of Ultra Instinct Omen Goku might very well have been Toei's to probably create hype for the special and keep the audience interested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the manga, Toyataro is ultimately forced to follow the main plot line of Toriyama's original draft. However, at the same time, Toyotaro definitely has the freedom to incorporate his own ideas and deviate from the script.&lt;br&gt;In a discussion between Toyotaro and Toriyama with regard to the &lt;a href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/dragon-ball-super-tori-toyo-free-talk-vol-2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Future Trunks arc"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was outright stated that the differences we see in the manga and anime; one good example of the same is Vegeta using Super Saiyan God, are Toyotaros ideas. Toriyama  himself encourages Toyataro to incorporate his own ideas into the main plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akira Toriyama indeed supervises the manga. However, his supervision is mainly with regard to the main plot line and certain differences we see in the manga are mainly Toyotaro's ideas which Toriyama accepts (Like the Super Saiyan God Vegeta).&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime and presumably the manga, we see at least one instance of Ichigo using Zangetsu to purify a soul.  But how is this possible?  Zangetsu is the manifestation of Ichigo's Quincy power, which is known to destroy souls rather than purify them.  How does this work? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41138">&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why Ichigo can purify Hollows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rukia transferred her powers into Ichigo&lt;/strong&gt;, which would mean that he not only has the ability to see Hollows properly, but also that his general Soul Reaper powers would largely mirror hers.  He wouldn't have inherited any of her abilities, but the situation would be no different than him being a Soul Reaper trainee sent on assignment in the real world, fighting and purifying Hollows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ichigo has these powers innately with him&lt;/strong&gt;, given that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; his father was the former 10th squadron's captain, and that would make him also half-Soul Reaper and half-Quincy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, at a miniumum, any previously awakened powers were only &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; in capacity, but not directly impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="15455" Title="Do manga publishers accept mangas from multiple artists under one pen-name?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Is it allowed for a single legal mangaka entity to consist of multiple artists, each of which does different part of the job, like in Bakuman? For example, one makes the stories and the other does the drawing. Will a manga publisher work with such teams? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="15457">&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine why the publishers would not allow that. Historically, it has been done by many writer circles &#8722; they publish their works under one pen-name, something the readers can remember easily than the actual names of several people involved. It's a good reason to use a pen-name and publishers generally don't protest if the artist want to use one.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;It has been confirmed by L that if a person's name is written in the Death Note, and they are written to die in a form that specifies another person's name, (like &quot;L Lawliet will die after he deletes all his evidence on Light Yagi and goes to Misa Amani's apartment&quot;) then all of them would die of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note#How_to_Use:_XI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rule XI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;[...] once the victim's name has been written, the individual's death can never be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rule above may appear to trump &lt;a href=&quot;http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note#How_to_Use:_X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rule X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack. [...]&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, it does not. &quot;The victim&quot; is automatically anyone whose name is written in the Death Note.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose somebody uses a Death Note to kill someone and specifies another person's name in the description. &lt;strong&gt;Will that person &#8212; who is specified, but not intended to be killed &#8212; live, if the Death Note user does not know their face?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="22246">&lt;p&gt;The person would live in many cases. That rule indeed says that if multiple people are specified, that they all would end up having a heart attack, but &lt;strong&gt;it does not circumvent all the other existing rules&lt;/strong&gt;. You would still need to have the person's face in mind while writing and the name should be the person's real name and not a nickname. The only thing that rule says is that all other details regarding the first person's death are just ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Person A stabbed to the heart. Person A would hug person B and would then kill person C. Person D would become jealous and would stab person A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Death Note would read it as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Person A &lt;strike&gt;stabbed to the heart.&lt;/strike&gt; Person A &lt;strike&gt;would hug&lt;/strike&gt; Person B &lt;strike&gt;and would then kiss&lt;/strike&gt; Person C. Person D &lt;strike&gt;would become jealous and would stab &lt;/strike&gt;Person A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Person A&lt;br&gt;
  Person B&lt;br&gt;
  Person C&lt;br&gt;
  Person D  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unless you had the specific person's face in mind while writing the name or unless the name was fake, the person would die from a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22268">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note#How_to_Use:_I" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Use: I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, answer for this question is
&lt;strong&gt;That people, who Deathnote user does not know their face, will live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="40894" Title="Why doesn't Sasuke use Shadow clones?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In one episode, when young Naruto and Sasuke were to fight each other in a duel guided by Iruka Sensei, Sasuke was able to create his shadow clone easily. Also, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/30430/how-itachi-was-able-to-use-shadow-clone&quot;&gt;How Itachi was able to use Shadow clone?&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow clone Jutsu is not imposed by any bloodline limits. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why does Sasuke did not use this useful technique in any of his fights? And why neither of Naruto's friends from &lt;a href=&quot;http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Konoha_11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Team 11&lt;/a&gt; seems to interest in learning this jutsu?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Naruto has showcased in his most fights that Shadow clone jutsu can be very useful. Sure many Ninja must have felt intrigued to learn it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40895">&lt;p&gt;The Shadow Clone technique is useful for distracting opponents, but as a downside it divides chakra amongst the clones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naruto is a ninja who attacks without a concrete plan, so the technique helps him in his foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sasuke, on the other hand, thinks before fighting, and doesn't have the chakra reserve that Naruto has (provided by Kurama).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my guess is more chakra related.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40898">&lt;p&gt;Can Sasuke use the Shadow Clone Justu? Sure he can! However, he chooses not to because he does not want to associate himself with using Naruto's signature justu, which he sees as Naruto's weakness and coping method to his loneliness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Shadow Clone Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Due to Naruto's extensive usage of this technique, Sasuke sees it as a symbolic way for Naruto to avoid loneliness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is referencing the manga, Chapter 696&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKcC2.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKcC2.png" alt="chapter 696"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a scene in the anime (which I can't vouch for being in the manga or not) during Sasuke's training where Orochimaru has him slay &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyAmkr4HjN0" rel="noreferrer"&gt;1,000 un-named ninjas&lt;/a&gt;. Sasuke sees himself strong enough to not even need the help of Shadow Clones&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="48301">&lt;p&gt;I think it is due to the part of shadow clone training that kinda gets forgotten with the knowledge transfer. I'm talking about how not only do you get the knowledge of the clone when it disperses, but you also get the clones fatigue. Sure you can make 9 clones and train for 1 hour then disperse them and get the knowledge benefit of training for 10 hours, but you also get the sudden fatigue of doing 10 hours worth of work in under 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naruto has extremely fast healing and a lot of stamina/chakra due to Kurama and his own natural ability (son of Minato and reincarnation of Ashura), but even he passed out from having too many clones just cutting 1 leaf in their hand then disperse (&lt;em&gt;Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; ep. 73).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the fatigue transfer, I think Sasuke may have been worried that it would affect the lifespan of his eyes before he got the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. Afterward, I think he just felt he didn't need the technique, plus he associated it with Naruto and his fear of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Kakashi, he just uses so many chakra techniques and would copy techniques on the fly, so it was almost always a better move to keep his chakra pool as large as possible to be able to use whatever technique he would need, and he doesn't have the chakra or stamina of either adult Sasuke or Naruto.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="3334" Title="What did the old man say to the bartender at the end?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the short one-shot &lt;strong&gt;Death Billiards&lt;/strong&gt;, the old man says something to the bartender at the end when they choose which elevator to get into (presumably, one goes to hell and the other to heaven). What did the old man say? He smirked at the end so it seemed like he got something that he wanted or had somehow tricked the younger man. The bartender wouldn't say what it was. Am I missing something or is this just completely wide-open-ended?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3351">&lt;p&gt;As the white-haired bartender said, &lt;em&gt;"&#31192;&#23494;&#12391;&#12377;," (himitsu desu, it's a secret).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such an open-ended ending, there's no way to know for sure (much like the "&lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/116/63"&gt;Cart Driver Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;" in Code Geass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story implies that the younger guy went to heaven while the older dude went to hell, with the masks above their respective elevators with a white face and a demon face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, who is to say any of them went to heaven or hell? Or that things are exactly as they are described by the white-haired bartender?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the intention of such an open-ended ending is to get viewers to form their version of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some points to consider are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the bartender was lying (or at least telling a half-truth and leaving out key details) from the beginning makes you question all of his explanations. Which parts are red herring? Which parts are true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; If you look closely, the so-implied "corpses" the bartender shows the young man are actually marionette parts (look closely at the legs hanging towards the middle right). The bartender mentions that when they arrived, they were of equal footing, perhaps referring to the fact that none of them had their original memories... and with each ball pocketed by the opposing side they got a bit of their memory back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the game (and its outcome) was predetermined &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; and the old man was supposed to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the old man arrives after the young man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; (even though the bartender mentions that those that die at the &lt;em&gt;same time&lt;/em&gt; are invited there). If they died at the same time, wouldn't they arrive at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that they leave in the same elevator they came from (at least the old man does)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the old man bites his lip before the white-haired bartender hugs the young man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the old man's flashback happens in reverse order compared to the young man's and also&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; how the old man's death is never shown, nor is the first memory of his last moment truly his. It was actually the old man's wife's and his memorial portrait is shown, with offerings meaning that he probably was already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, the jellyfish. The jellyfish are a recurring symbol throughout the series, from the chandeliers to the aquarium, and the stained glass pattern behind the counter and the same design on the bathroom tiles. According to shamanism the &lt;a href="http://healing.about.com/od/animaltotems/ss/oceanic-totems.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;jellyfish totem&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to represent "inner strength, vulnerability, transparency, and truth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this, we can imply that although there is a game of life and death going on, it is not as the bartender describes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The bartender mentions that he is the "&#12373;&#12356;&#12390;&#12356;&#32773;" which can be implied to be the "arbiter", the person who decides if someone goes to "heaven" or "hell"... however, who is being judged is never directly stated. The setting could be a place in limbo and it could be just the young man that is being judged, not for whether he goes to heaven or hell, but if he deserves a second chance (&#12373;&#12356;&#12390;&#12356; can also mean "second chance"), whether to be reincarnated or getting a second chance in his current life. The presence of the old man might be there to play a devil's advocate type of role to prevent this from happening. The old man might be a person that was condemned to hell and given a second chance to be able to be reincarnated if he can reveal the bad side of darkness and sink him into despair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the old man asks the bartender near the end could be something like "Is the game over (can I move on)?" and the bartender's reply could be, "not yet."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This could be why the old man bites his lip. Because he knows he's lost. His smile as the elevator door closes could be because he knows that he'll be back for another shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the plot and ending is so open-ended, a lot of other things can be implied... much like the ending to &lt;em&gt;Inception.&lt;/em&gt; You're meant to infer the ending that you want, rather than be told what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostess seems to be a bit out of place. The piano player is a marionette moved by wires, and it is demonstrated that the wires can move things around. There seems to be no need for a hostess, as she does not serve a particular function (the bartender makes the drinks, she is only seen receiving the empty glass of water). Most of her other actions after the game starts are imitating the bartender's...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; What if she was a person that lost the game and is stuck in this limbo until she discovers the true meaning of life and herself like the young man did. As the credits roll, the hostess first asks the bartender what the old man said to him, he immediately says that it's "a secret," but when she asks who went to what place, instead of telling her that it's a secret, he asks what she thinks, perhaps asking her if she's learned anything, she replies she's asking because she doesn't know, he replies that it's a secret... perhaps implying that she is not yet ready to know... her own fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, though the gg Fansub translate the name of the place as "Queen Decim," I personally believe the place to be called "Quindecim(e)", the latin word for "15" (&#21313;&#20116;, &#12376;&#12421;&#12358;&#12372;, "jyuugo"), perhaps implying the Ten Epithets of Buddha (&#21313;&#21495;, also "jyuugou")?&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;The Anime has stated quite a lot of times that Kekkai Genkai is a genetic leverage that some clans have, which allow them to combine 2 elements into a new style.&#10;(Like for example, wind + water makes the ice release and Earth + lightning makes the explosion release). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I'm more interested in thou, is if its possible for a prodigy who can use 2 elements, to combine them. To be more specific I'm asking if its possible for Boruto to create a new release by combining lightning and wind style. (I don't even know what the combination of wind and lightning creates).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm really interested in this because there has been some individuals who have used releases from combinations of 2 elements without being from a notable &quot;Kekkai genkai known clan&quot;. An example is deidra, who could use the explosion style and also darui, the wiki even states that: &quot;By combining his water and lightning-natures, he can utilise Storm Release&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So could Boruto possibly create a new release of his own by incorporating lightning style and combining it with wind nature. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="46150" Title="Why is Suzaku able to see C.C. through the Knightmare?"

</answer></question><question Id="5412" Title="What is the origin of the &quot;Hidden&quot; event in Fairy Tail?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Fairy Tail chapter 269 during the Grand Magic Games arc, there is an event called &lt;em&gt;Hidden&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The participants are transported to different locations inside a giant city.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They have to find an attack each other using either a physical or magical attack.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The participant who successfully lands an attack earns a point, which gets deducted from the attacked participant.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now comes the tricky part: The city gets filled with clones of the participants, and they will now have to hide between the clones and try to find the original ones. Because if a participant attacks a clone, he or she loses a point.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find this very similar to multiplayer games such as Assassin's Creed where you have a target hiding between NPCs and you have to guess which one it is based on its behavior (e.g. if he acts in a strange suspicious way).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So is there some origin to this game concept? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5413">&lt;p&gt;As far as the origin of the concept is concerned, I think only Hiro Mashima can tell!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only Assassins Creed but many other games have this kind of concept. It's actually a very simple concept where you picture yourself as a wanted person and try to hide in the crowd around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiro Mashima just made it more exciting by cloning the contestants and making it way more difficult to find the right person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I can answer is that he must have combined the concept of Hiding and the concept of Shadow Clones from Naruto!&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5422">&lt;p&gt;The origin is literally impossible to trace. At best, we'll see who implemented this idea first but it could have been thought of a long time ago or done in many things that we don't have knowledge of. Hiro Mashima (the manga-ka) might be able to say where he got this or why he decided on this but its not exactly a rare idea to do this. Its pretty much a simple twist on a "zero sum" kind of game. I'm almost certain that Assassin's Creed was not the first to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, in earlier chapters of Fairy Tail, Mashima used to scribble "Mashima's ramblings" in the gaps or sides of the page. From these "ramblings", we know Hiro Mashima does play video games (and at the very least, owns a PS3). So even if Assasin's Creed multiplayer was not the first to implement this system, there is some offchance that Mashima got the idea from playing that game.&lt;/p&gt;

IF that is true, then Aqua and Kazuma were the first two players to start the game. then on, two other friends join in the form of Darkness and Megumin, and the rest is history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also very likely, Darkness has money saved up. (enough to lodge, but not enough to pay off the debts they rack up later into the series) and Megumin has the same situation. But I still think the writer only makes the characters relevant as they come up, and decided not to worry about the details before they became relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Given the amount of evidence that presented in the Manga and Anime, it is likely that when they appeared in Axel Town, they recently arrived. Given how famished Megumin is, she probably only arrived after her journey, and thus could not establish somewhere to lodge, and needed to find a quick source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47203">&lt;p&gt;Within the anime, there has been no mention of where Darkness and Megumin lived prior to obtaining the mansion (not that I recall). However, in the KonoSuba manga, Darkness and Megumin both had slept in the stables as illustrated:&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm just curious, does Naruto Shippuuden retain its original seiyuu from Naruto (voice actors)? Or there are certain changes with the voice actors? If there are changes, what are they and what were the reasons for changing?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3608">&lt;p&gt;Naruto has a lot of different voice actors, but mainly for other languages. In Japanese, Naruto has only had 2 voice actors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/people/15/Junko_Takeuchi" rel="nofollow"&gt;Takeuchi, Junko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/people/727/Ema_Kogure" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kogure, Ema&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kogure Ema has only voiced Naruto in &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; (before the time skip). &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ema_Kogure" rel="nofollow"&gt;I believe she even only did 1 technique which would be Naruto's "Sexy Technique"&lt;/a&gt;. Takeuchi Junko is Naruto's main voice actor; she has voiced Naruto in all movies  and specials, also through out &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to scare you all a bit too, Naruto's voice actor also voices &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/4799/Akamaru" rel="nofollow"&gt;Akamaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/23569/Guruko" rel="nofollow"&gt;Guruko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/34115/Hina" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/74930/Menma" rel="nofollow"&gt;Menma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the casting for the Japanese version of the animated adaptations, the staff sought a male voice actor for Naruto. Junko Takeuchi, a female actress, was instead chosen following a large number of auditions that involved male actors. Before recording the first episode, Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with exclamations points which helped her define Naruto's voice. She noted difficulties in transitioning from the naruto which is young to the eledest of three in the animated adaptation of Part II, as she had to record the first episode after the time skip only one week after voicing the character from before the time skip. This concerned the character's growth as Naruto started acting more mature in contrast to his attitude of a child. It was difficult for Takeuchi to voice Naruto in his Nine-Tailed Demon Fox form and during the fight against Sasuke, due to the suffering Naruto was going through. Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding it tough to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion regarding him changed to "a very reliable young man". She admires his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki" rel="nofollow"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="3614">&lt;p&gt;The answer is: sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of characters who have multiple voice actors, but those don't (as far as I can tell) change as the show goes on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kakashi&lt;/a&gt; is a character who has a second seiyuu in Shippuden, but it is one who voices him as a child. Normally, and through both Naruto and Shippuden, he is voiced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuhiko_Inoue" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kazuhiko Inoue&lt;/a&gt;, but as a child, he is voiced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutsumi_Tamura" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mutsumi Tamura&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orochimaru has had four seiyuu: one for his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujira" rel="nofollow"&gt;normal body&lt;/a&gt;, one for his body as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuriko_Yamaguchi_%28voice_actor%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Grass ninja&lt;/a&gt;, one for him in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachiko_Kojima" rel="nofollow"&gt;female body&lt;/a&gt;, and one for him as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayumi_Yamaguchi" rel="nofollow"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deidara's voice actor in the English dub is different between his episode 135 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_Flynn" rel="nofollow"&gt;cameo&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Craig_Smith" rel="nofollow"&gt;role in Shippuden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sasori has three seiyuu: one for as an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahiro_Sakurai" rel="nofollow"&gt;adult&lt;/a&gt;, one for as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiko_Yajima" rel="nofollow"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;, and one for as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutaka_Aoyama" rel="nofollow"&gt;puppet body&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobi has three seiyuu: one for when he is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Takagi" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tobi&lt;/a&gt;, one for when he is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Uchida" rel="nofollow"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and one for when he is a child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shikamaru has a different seiyuu for episode 141. Normally, he's voiced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtaro_Morikubo" rel="nofollow"&gt;Showtaro Morikubo&lt;/a&gt;, but in that episode, he was voiced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobutoshi_Canna" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nobutoshi Canna&lt;/a&gt;. I can't find why that switch happened, except that Nobutoshi Canna was the stand-in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konohamaru has a similar situation: he is usually voiced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikue_%C5%8Ctani" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ikue Otani&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiko_Koike" rel="nofollow"&gt;Akiko Koike&lt;/a&gt; acted as a stand-in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, there is nobody who specifically changes seiyuu between Naruto and Shippuden, but these are characters who have multiple seiyuu for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter/episode-9-beware-x-of-x-prisoners-585056&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;episode 9&lt;/a&gt; of the 2011 version of &lt;em&gt;Hnter x Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, Kurapika's fight is with the prisoner Majitani.  They agree to a battle to the death.  Once Majitani realizes he is hopelessly outmatched, he says &quot;I surrender!&quot; (time code 18:41)  Kurapika is already in the process of punching him, and knocks him out. The surrender is never acknowledged, and there is a verbal dispute over whether Majitani is dead.  The other prisoners claim that Kurapika's match must end before Leorio's can begin. Majitani's surrender is never brought up by either side.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One might argue that in a death battle, surrender is irrelevant.  Yet the first match, between Tonpa and Bendot, was also a death battle.  Tonpa was allowed to surrender. Presumably this was because when the examiner Lippo explained the rules, he stated, &quot;A winner is declared when the opponent admits defeat&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter/episode-8-decision-x-by-x-majority-585054&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;episode 8&lt;/a&gt;, time code 14:17).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(following paragraph added next day)&lt;br&gt;&#10;Everything Majitani said and did prior to and during his match with Kurapika was meant to intimidate. Calling for a death match was part of that strategy. He knew he was not really a strong fighter, so I believe his goal was to get Kurapika to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Majitani's surrender not matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One might claim that no one heard it, not even Kurapika. But then dramatically, what was the point in having the surrender in the first place? If it's just going to be there, unexplained and unmentioned, it will just cause some nerd to come to a q&amp;amp;a site and ask about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a tree falls in the forest ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50122">&lt;p&gt;I don't know about the anime, but in the manga, Bendot explicitly said, they would fight until one of them surrenders or dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kurapikkas fight they agreed to fight to the death. The rest is as you said. He wasn't dead, so the fight was not over. But Kurapika heard the surrender of Majitani, so he refused to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="50141">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Majitani's surrender not matter?&lt;/strong&gt; I compared both anime and manga (official translation) scenes and they seem to be different. In the anime, &lt;em&gt;Majitani was able to at least say that he surrenders&lt;/em&gt;. In the manga, &lt;em&gt;he did not get the chance to do so&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Majitani can say anything more than 'Lay off, okay? I-', he was punched by Kurapika. &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T1qLQ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T1qLQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what he was able to say before being knocked out cold, I do not think that can even be considered a formal surrender nor an admittance of defeat. He was only able to say 'lay off', not say 'I give up', and while he might be on the verge of surrendering had Kurapika not punched him, &lt;em&gt;he was unable to do so&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, I think this means that 'his surrender', if he ever meant to, will never count. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One might claim that no one heard it, not even Kurapika.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, Kurapika certainly did not hear it. Later on in &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 18&lt;/strong&gt;, he admitted that even though he knew the tattoo was fake, &lt;em&gt;he was unable to control his emotions&lt;/em&gt;. From the manga:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kurapika (to Gon and Leorio): My mind perceived that tattoo was a fake..but my emotions..I just saw red..and..to be honest..whenever I see a spider, any spider..&lt;strong&gt;my rationality collapses, and I turn primal&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explains his actions, and seeing 'red' seems to be real, as seen &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/seeing-red-its-not-just-an-expression-for-angry-people-but-also-scientific-fact-9194815.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Even if Kurapika knew that Majitani was going to surrender, he let his emotions get the better of him (despite this, he technically did not break the rules as Majitani, again, was not able to fully say that he surrender or give up). In addition, I also know someone personally who cannot remember what he/she did or what happened after he/she saw red when he/she was so angry at someone, similar to what Kurapika experienced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the point in having the surrender in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, nothing other than the fact that it would also work for the prisoners especially if they feel that the hunter examinees they encounter are too strong for them. In the case of Majitani and Kurapika's bout, it was not that the rule was discarded or ignored. It was that M&lt;em&gt;ajitani was not able to fully state his surrender, mainly because of Kurapika's actions&lt;/em&gt;, so that it looked like the rule was ignored, when in fact it was not. If I remember correctly, &lt;em&gt;there are no rules not allowing someone to prevent his/her opponent from surrendering&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Later on in the series (I think at DB-Z second half, but I am not sure), they were not shown on-screen anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Considering the whole Dragon Ball series (DB-Z, DB-GT, etc)...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What happened to them? Were they destroyed, gifted, lost, stolen, or just hung out to dry?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14224">&lt;p&gt;Regarding the fate of the flying cloud (Kinto'un), according to &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Nimbus" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flying Nimbus&lt;/a&gt; article on Dragon Ball wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During Dragon Ball Z, the Nimbus was used by Goku during the Vegeta Saga. He used the Nimbus to chase down and save Gohan from Raditz, and to race toward the battlefield to save his friends from the Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa. The Nimbus perhaps most notably saved Gohan from being stomped to death by Nappa. After recovering in the hospital from the injuries he received during the fight with Vegeta, Goku uses the Nimbus once more to travel to the Capsule Corporation and begin his journey to Namek in Dr. Brief's Capsule Corporation spaceship. This is Nimbus' last appearance for quite some time, as most characters learned high-speed flight, which far outclasses the Nimbus' speed.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is seen again in the Great Saiyaman Saga when Gohan also used it to fly from Mount Paozu to Orange Star High School, and even raced with it after becoming Great Saiyaman. &lt;strong&gt;He later gave it to his little brother Goten&lt;/strong&gt; after getting the Great Saiyaman Watch from Bulma, which allowed him to fly without the fear of someone recognizing him. &lt;strong&gt;The Nimbus is only used by Goten once,&lt;/strong&gt; as he would soon learn to fly after Gohan teaches him. &lt;strong&gt;This would be the final time the cloud would appear in Dragon Ball Z.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In the 2004 kanzenban edition of the manga,&lt;/strong&gt; four new pages drawn by Akira Toriyama were added to the final Dragon Ball manga volume. &lt;strong&gt;They depict Goku giving his Flying Nimbus to Uub while they are leaving Papaya Island.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the extending staff (Nyoibou), according to &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Pole" rel="nofollow"&gt;Power Pole&lt;/a&gt; article on Dragon Ball wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Goku shows up for the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, he is also carrying the Power Pole. After the 23rd tournament, Goku uses the pole to fight Annin in the final episode of Dragon Ball. Four years later, Goku uses the Power Pole against Garlic Jr. and his henchmen in the movie Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone. While Goku was training with King Kai in the Other World after his death fighting Raditz, the Power Pole was shown strung between Korin Tower and Kami's Lookout. Brought by Gohan in Wheelo's fortress, Goku uses the Power Pole again in the battle with Dr. Wheelo in Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest. Following this, Goku retires the Power Pole, presumably because he does not have much use for it with his rapidly ascending power.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In the Garlic Jr. Saga, the pole is not between Korin Tower and Kami's Lookout but in Korin's possession, as seen when he bets it in a poker game with Maron and Yajirobe. &lt;strong&gt;The Power Pole is later seen extending from Korin Tower to the Lookout several times during the course of Dragon Ball Z, and Goku is seen with it one final time in the Japanese ending credits of "Until We Meet Again", the last episode of Dragon Ball GT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in the 2 articles, the flying cloud and the extending staff are still there, but no one really uses them. Goku has the extending staff with him in GT, but that is later in the series and he doesn't even use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoilers below for those who don't follow the manga, but have just seen the Anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; As you mentioned that all Titans are actually humans, that have been converted into the Titans (currently unknown methods). All Titans are compelled to eat humans since there lies a possibility that they may be Titan Shifters. If the Titan dies the human who it was before is also dead, since there is now no way for it to turn back and the body vaporises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more spoilers and history about the Titans: &lt;a href="http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Titans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Titans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39368">&lt;p&gt;I will try and answer by spoiling as little as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read all manga chapters (including the newest one, 91).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; We have two types of Titans (so far): shifters, and non-shifters. A shifter is a Titan whose human can voluntarily transform into and out of the Titan shape. As far as we know, shifters are only the 9 original Titans. We also know that there is a certain serum that can transform a human into a mindless Titan. This serum was injected to Ymir (the person) and like all other mindless Titans, she wandered around until she accidentally ate a human who was a Titan shifter (Reiner's and Bertlod's friend). As such Ymir transformed into a human, obtaining the power of the so-called "Dancing Titan".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the next spoiler (approximately manga chapter 88 and above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Only "The people of Ymir" (&lt;a href="http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Eldia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Eldians&lt;/a&gt;, including Eren and the people inside the walls) can be transformed into Titans. Furthermore, the people inside the walls live on an island called Paradis Island, although far from the shore. Knowing that, the Marley government gathers Eldians on top of a wall next to the shore (but far from the walls), injects them with the serum and throws them on the ground. These Titans wander around eventually finding the walls and creating problems for the people of the walls. (A nice counter strategy from Marley, using a weapon they cannot control). The plot thickens when Marley has managed to convince Eldians to fight for them. These Eldians, such as Reiner, Bertold, Annie, Zeke, each hold one of the 9 original Titans power, and can easily transform from Titan to human to Titan again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) If you are talking about Titan shifters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you cannot kill a Titan without killing the human inside. The methods used by the Survey Corps are pretty much cutting off their nape. If you cut the nape of a Titan-shifter, then you are left with the human body of that Titan-shifter. If you consume the spinal cord fluid of this human body, you will obtain his/her Titan-shifting power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) If you are talking about mindless Titans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then if you cut off the nape, there is no trace left of the human who was turned into this Titan. As far as it is revealed, we cannot say if the person evaporated, died, or something else. It is assumed that the person inside a mindless Titan dies, when the nape of the Titan is cut off. Hange speculated that the spinal cord and the central nervous system of a mindless Titan functions separately from the body. Maybe that means that the human body simply turns into a mindless Titan, thus leaving no human body inside of such a Titan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A list of the 9 original Titans is &lt;a href="http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Titan_shifter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40271">&lt;p&gt;Ok, a lot of spoilers from chapter 1-92 but pretty much: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; when Eldians are turned into mindless titans, their titan form 'absorbs' the human until only the spinal cord remains. When a soldier cuts the nape of the titan, he/she will sever the top of the spinal cord, therefore 'decapitating' the human inside, so like one of the other answers, it could be said that the titan only dies when the human (or what remains) is killed.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="46400" Title="Could a koukaku ghoul be fast?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I know that Koukaku ghouls are generally slow due to their kagune being heavy hitting armor protruding from below their shoulder blade, but there are other things that factor into how fast a ghoul is, like lower body strength and stuff, right? So couldn't a Koukaku ghoul also be extremely fast? I mean, Kaneki had that heavy hitting centipede Half-Kakuja that was huge, and he was still so fast, he was running on the freaking ceiling! So I think it's possible if they were very strong, and if they had a pretty lightweight kagune, they could be fast, too. However, those are my thoughts on the matter and I would like a second opinion. Actually, it would really make me feel better if I got quite a few opinions on the matter, because I'm mostly going off speculation here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47255">&lt;p&gt;I think it is just like you said, but this is just an opinion, as i couldn't find any information about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we take ghouls as humans, a little child would be slower than a man if both were walking with a 30kg backpack just because the man is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a ghoul with koukaku should be able to increase is speed, to the point that would be considered fast, but it would be so much harder because it would not only take him to train his speed but also his strength and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; I consider this to be posible because there are no negative effects regarding to koukako (it is just heavy  and extremely robust)&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://kurokonobasuke.wikia.com/wiki/Teik%C5%8D_Junior_High&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Teiko basketball club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Kuroko no Basket&lt;/em&gt; is described as an incredibly strong team with over 100 members that won the championship three times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, only 6 in the main roster and 2 of their senpai(s) are actually shown and mentioned in the whole anime. The other 92+ players were never mentioned and are literally useless. They also affected the basketball in middle school, where they themselves got more and more bored and their enemies gave up before even playing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I'm wondering why would 92+ players even join the basketball club when they obviously have no chance to play in a real match?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21707">&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how this works in Japan, but I could imagine that the school has multiple teams for different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they couldn't get into the main basketball team, and play in a lower or younger team.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="21840">&lt;p&gt;The second/third string in Teiko play matches against weaker schools. In one of the OVAs (Tip Off) Kise (when he first joined) and Kuroko help the second string in an exibition match. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, first years and even second years would not usually make first string right away in a bigger school, but they still need training so that they can possibly join later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could just have joined to play/practise basketball. Remember that it's a &lt;strong&gt;club&lt;/strong&gt; not just a team. I doubt that anyone would even attempt to join if they had to make first string. It's pretty clear playing in matches is a privilge for most people, not an expected outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="21853">&lt;p&gt;If it's anything like when I was in school (which isn't too long ago):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be age-limited leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in my first year, there were leagues that only allowed first year players to compete. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be multi-tiered leagues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like soccer, there could be an A-league, B-league, C-league, etc. Generally our school would put one team in each league - according with skill of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players join for the fun of it, rather than the competition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a short stint at playing volleyball and really enjoyed it - I didn't want to play it competitively though, and that's the attitude a good few others might have too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still the opportunity to get in the lead team with enough time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; games to be played by the other players, there's still the opportunity to get on the team that plays. Anime sports rosters don't change that much, but if a coach sees one player who is really good but isn't playing - they'll probably bring them onto the team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(card_game)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is a westernized verison of the japanese game "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daifug%C5%8D" rel="noreferrer"&gt;daifug&#333;&lt;/a&gt;" (perhaps that is the actual game, but localized) where it ranges from the daifug&#333; (Grand millionaire) to the Daihinmin (Extreme Needy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a variant which allows "revolutions"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a player leads out with four of a kind, the hierarchy of all the cards will be reversed. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For example, if 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A,2 is the typical order of power (from left to right), after four of a kind is played it would be the reverse of that: 2,A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If another four of a kind is played, the order would switch back. Revolutions are typically utilized in the game to create better balance and avoid having the same player remain in first position indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of the game of course is to be the highest ranking person :)&lt;/p&gt;

Goku can gather this energy from &lt;I&gt;inanimate life forms and surrounding objects&lt;/I&gt; as well for the spirit bomb. Hence, in other words, Goku can't gather energy from a rock and regain stamina.&lt;br&gt;Secondly, the androids have infinite "Stamina" which prevents them from getting tired like a normal individual. This might be because of mechanical part fitted inside Android 17. So it would be impossible for Android 17 to share his energy with Goku. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A better analogy would be something like this.&lt;li&gt;Let us assume there exist 2 human beings and 1 robot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Human beings need x amount of blood to survive while the robot has a fitted energy source which is different from blood but always keeps them alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If one human is deprived of blood, he needs to rely on the other human and can't ask help from the robot despite him having an infinite energy source because the human has a different anatomy compared to the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="23695" Title="Why didn't the Task Force capture Misa Amane?" Body="&lt;p&gt;After the final meeting and Light's death, everyone in the room knew the truth. They knew that the 13 day rule was fake, and the rule about destroying the Death Note was fake, too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also had many evidences against Misa (the tapes, fingerprints, hair, etc.), and Light also screamed &quot;Misa write their names&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At this point, they had enough proof that Misa was Second Kira, but why didn't they capture her? Why did they let her go?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23787">&lt;p&gt;She was let go because to be a GOD you have to have the brains to kill. Of course she was just killing for Light, also she almost did no harm, just what was right for her lover. And then again she's suffered enough halving her lifespan twice now, She might have not much long to live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why was she let free? If you remember she's lost memory of all that she did. The detectives must have thought she was innocent enough that they let her go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: They skipped her because she was distancing away from the main character and the author was too focused on its main pieces like "L" simply being killed in the middle of the anime :D&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="24525">&lt;p&gt;all they had was misa's clothes fiber if I recall correctly...the better question is why would they ignore the false finger prints and put the weight on the clothes fiber...so L rightfully figured that the prints were false but the fibers thats where its at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also you can probably presume they did go after her...didnt the show end at that point&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26652">&lt;p&gt;Maybe the author don't want to lower the excitement in climax because even Near going after Mesa can't prove she is second kira which may leave us a puzzled climax. Mesa lost her memories after forsaking the ownership of her notebook. Near won't be able to prove she is second kira because N works almost like L it will be same like when L tried to prove Mesa as second kira by confining her and Lite for month. There is one secret that Near still unaware of, deathnote ownership and he obviously don't know if deathnote owner forsaken their ownership their memories are lost and when come in contact with their deathnote they can regain their memories until their contact with deathnote. Even if they captured Mesa for investigation they may never make her touch deathnote cause they know of second kira eye power danger. If after writing Lite name in his notebook Reyuk(shinigami) will take Lites deathnote and go to his world. Near and other police will be left with a deathnote without shinigami. Then also they can never know of deathnote ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27401">&lt;p&gt;I think we need to consider all the times she was held under watch for one reason or another. First was under suspicion for being the second kira, during which she lost her memories and the bulk of the task force then believed she was innocent and harmless (aside from L who was figuring out why she went from determinedly silent to the ditzy blonde) Then after L's death, Near manages to bring up Aizawa ' s doubts involving Light, and even misa. So with Ide and Mogi to back him up, they have Mogi keep an eye on her under the guise of police protection where she does nothing even hinting at ulterior motives (having already submitted ownership to Mikami per Light's order)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally you have Near and the SPK keeping her and Mogi in captivity under surveillance again until 1 hour before the meet up where Misa is dropped off at a high class hotel and allowed to call Light.
Near knew full well in his theorizing that Misa was the 2nd kira. But by this point it would stand to reason that they all deemed her no longer a threat. With the last 2 books burned and no sympathetic shinigami to give her a new one and restore her memories, she could really do nothing about the situation and doesn't even know she committed any crime.&lt;/p&gt;

This story was later realized as a manga by Aoi Hiiragi who did the manga "Whisper of the Heart" was based on and then turned into a movie.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 1995, Studio Ghibli released a film entitled Whisper of the Heart, based on a manga by Aoi Hiiragi, of a girl writing a fantasy novel. Although the girl's life had no magical elements, the film featured short fantasy scenes depicting what the girl was writing of the Baron, a character of her novel, which were so popular that an indirect sequel was made, featuring the Baron and another girl, a high school student, named Haru. Muta also returned. The Cat Returns began as the "Cat Project" in 1999. Studio Ghibli received a request from a Japanese theme park to create a 20-minute short starring cats. Hayao Miyazaki wanted three key elements to feature in the short &#8212; these were the Baron, Muta (Moon) and a mysterious antique shop. Hiiragi was commissioned to create the manga equivalent of the short, which is called Baron: The Cat Returns (&#12496;&#12525;&#12531; &#29483;&#12398;&#30007;&#29237; Baron: Neko no Danshaku, lit. Baron: The Cat Baron) and is published in English by Viz Media. The theme park later canceled the project. Miyazaki then took the existing work done by the "Cat Project" and used it as testing for future Ghibli directors &#8212; the short was now to be 45 minutes long. Responsibility was given to Hiroyuki Morita, who had started as an animator in 1999 for the film My Neighbors the Yamadas. Over a nine-month period he translated Hiiragi's Baron story into 525 pages of storyboards for what was to be The Cat Returns. Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki decided to produce a feature-length film based entirely on Morita's storyboard; this was partly because Haru, the main character, had a "believable feel to her". It became the second theatrical (third overall) Studio Ghibli feature to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or Takahata. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="39903" Title="Is it possible to use Chidori without Sharingan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about Chidori and now I'm interested in it. I stumbled upon this question: can a ninja learn how to use Chidori and use it without Sharingan? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39904">&lt;p&gt;Yes it is, but there is a cost, Tunnel-vision. Kakashi invented the attack and used it without the Sharingan, and were it not for Minato, he would have been killed by one of his opponents. He is running so fast, and is focused so much on his attack, that he is unable to really focus on anything except that right in front of him when attacking. The second Paragraph of the overview on the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chidori" rel="noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; confirms this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The speed at which the Chidori is performed, despite being one of its greatest assets, also represents one of its biggest drawbacks: users move at their target so fast that its causes a tunnel vision-like effect for them. Because they charge in a straight line it is easy for opponents to attack them, and because of the tunnel vision it is difficult for the user to see these attacks, much less react to them. For this reason, most ninja cannot use the Chidori safely. If the user has a Sharingan, however, these drawbacks are overcome: the Sharingan's heightened visual perception prevents the tunnel vision from occurring and its predictive capabilities make it easy for the user to avoid counterattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kakashi's page&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the event itself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kakashi tried to eliminate him with his new jutsu, Chidori, but the attack speed left him vulnerable to counter-attack, forcing Minato to step in, save Kakashi, and kill Mahiru himself. Before leaving them, Minato advised Kakashi to not use the Chidori again.
  ...
  After Rin transplanted Obito's Sharingan into him, Kakashi confronted Kakk&#333;. His White Light Chakra Sabre was destroyed during the ensuing fight, but he succeeded in killing Kakk&#333; with Chidori; due to the Sharingan's heightened vision, Kakashi was finally able to handle its speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42234">&lt;p&gt;If you think about it logically, many enhanced sensory abilities would counteract tunnel vision and allow you to use Chidori effectively. Byakugan totally eliminates any notion of tunnel vision. That's one of its main purposes. Sensor techniques, including Sage mode sensing, Mind's Eye of the Kaguya, and Mu's technique would provide the same advantage. While Karin was unable to take full advantage of her technique, due to her incompetent taijutsu, someone like Kakashi in possession of the technique would be quite capable of using it in combat to eliminate any possibility of tunnel vision. Mu actively demonstrated his ability to avoid attacks from his blind spot. Naruto's and Kabuto's threat perception both demonstrated this ability against high speed attacks. If they possessed Chidori, they would have no trouble utilizing it. If Ranmaru's Kekkei Genkai were cannon and in the possession of someone like Kakashi, tunnel vision would instantly cease to be an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="5114" Title="Did Saber recognize Illyasviel in Fate/Stay Night?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Fate Zero, Saber doesn't exactly meet Illyasviel, but she does see her, which is hard to forget because she looks pretty much exactly as her mother Irisviel, who was a good friend of Saber's.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Fate Stay Night, Saber runs into Illyasviel multiple times, and eventually Illyasviel ends up living with her in Shirou's house. But, as far as I'm concerned, Saber doesn't seem to &quot;react&quot; at all. By this I mean something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Oh boy, that's Illyasviel, damned Kiritusugu's daughter&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Whoa, she looks exactly like my good old friend Irisviel&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;von Einzbern? That rings a bell&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't seem (to me) that Saber actually realizes this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does Saber recognize Illyasviel? If yes, why doesn't she bring it up?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5116">&lt;p&gt;Yes, Saber's (Arthuria) situation as a Servant is unique. She is not a true heroic spirit, but rather an incomplete one (See: &lt;a href="http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Fate/Zero%3aAct_5_Part_1" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fate/Zero novel, Vol. 2, Act 5, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Saber - that is, Arturia - is an incomplete Heroic Spirit, she would not possess the knowledge that surpasses time and space one gains when one has reached the Throne of Heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Saber_%28Fate/stay_night%29#Contract" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Type Moon&lt;/a&gt; Wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Heroic Spirits are those who have been removed from the time axis and placed on the Throne of Heroes, while Saber can still be considered living. The hero known as King Arthur is not currently classified as a Heroic Spirit, so she cannot be called a complete Servant. She made a pact with the World as she was on the verge of death after the Battle of Camlann that will require her to become a Counter Guardian, a subcategory of a Heroic Spirit at the service of the World, after her death. These pacts are normally done by those requiring the power beyond ordinary humans to become heroes during their lifetimes, but her wish instead came at the time of her death because King Arthur did not require support to become a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having technically not died yet, Saber cannot take on Spirit Form like most other servants because she's technically still considered alive. This allows her to keep all memories of her search for the Grail, unlike Heroic Spirits don't keep their memories in order to prevent inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said she most likely realizes the positions she is in and the recurring characters, but does not act upon it would complicate matters (singling her out as an irregularity, raise unnecessarily questions that may distract her master).&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="46332">&lt;p&gt;If you pay close attention to &lt;em&gt;Fate/stay night: UBW&lt;/em&gt;, you may be able to tell that Saber recognizes Illyasviel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Illya first introduces herself, she says "Von Einsburn. Sounds familiar, Rin?" After she says that, Saber tilts her head down and sighs as if she is remembering something she doesn't want to think about. Though this evidence still leaves much to be desired, Saber has never been one to submit to her feelings and often keeps them concealed within. Therefore, she wouldn't likely say, "Oh my god. You're Irisviel's daughter." even if they were alone together especially because I'd imagine that Illya reminds Saber too much of Irisviel, who is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, if I were saber, I'd be acting the same way if I were in such a situation.&lt;/p&gt;

What does this mean? Does it mean that he can influence others destinys or lives? Change the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What are the laws of cause and effect?

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality" rel="nofollow"&gt;Causality's Wiki page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Causality (also referred to as causation) is the relation between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is understood as a consequence of the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also &lt;strong&gt;Causation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causation_%28disambiguation%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wiki page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=12&amp;amp;article=3716" rel="nofollow"&gt;God and the Laws of Science: The Law of Causality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&#8220;the principle that nothing can happen without being caused&#8221; (&#8220;Causality,&#8221; 2009). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&#8220;the principle that everything has a cause&#8221; (&#8220;Causality,&#8221; 2008).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/spirkin/works/dialectical-materialism/ch02-s06.html#AEN418" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Principle of Causality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nowhere in the world can there be any phenomena that do not give rise to certain consequences and have not been caused by other phenomena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And according to the link you gave, even the room where Deus located is called &lt;strong&gt;Cathedral of Causality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope those above answer the first question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second question, I guess you refer to the content of the law? As far as I know and understand, it's simply the same as its definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#8220;...nothing can happen without being caused&#8221; (&#8220;Causality,&#8221; 2009). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps, and sorry if I'm out of topic or get your question wrongly.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9775">&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, he made this statement to describe his creation of the future diaries. That said, whatever the original laws of cause and effect were, and whatever his alterations to the were, we know that the result is that people are now able to know events that will take place in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the very least, it can be concluded that the law of cause and effect that was changed is the law that it is impossible for a person to know future events, but the changing of this law has several loose ends that must be addressed as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the diary holder's mere knowledge of the event enough to alter the future? In the anime, the answer is no. A player must take action contrary or antithetical to the predicted event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is a diary holder's propensity or volition to take actions contrary to a prediction enough to change it? This isn't made entirely clear in the anime, as sometimes a character's volition to take different actions changes the prediction, while other times it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the two above items most likely constitute the "changes to the laws of time and space" that Deus made.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Hana Hana no Mi is eaten by Nico Robin, as we know that she can grow parts of her body.&#10;She usually grow her hands to attack, or to defend her. She also can swing or lift her or other people with her growing hands.&#10;She can easily break the bones of her opponents, just like when she used clutch or twist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know that if her body parts are hurts, she also feels the pain. But is that mean when she used clutch or twist, she used her &quot;normal&quot; human strength?&#10;Because she doesn't seems no trouble when do that to her opponents. Or it's because the Hana Hana no Mi that also give her superhuman strength?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27318">&lt;p&gt;I believe it is. Robin will not be able to control such huge limbs if the fruit did not give her any superhuman power. Furthermore, Robin's body is so thin and does not look like she's having any physical training.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27326">&lt;p&gt;If you are asking whether Robin was given superhuman strength by the fruit's powers, the answer is no. The duplicated limbs she creates are no stronger individually than her normal limbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Hana_Hana_no_Mi" rel="nofollow"&gt;the One Piece wiki's page on the Hana Hana no Mi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The strength of the user is also still limited to their individual strength, meaning that the individual strength in the replicating appendages is no different to that of Robin's actual corresponding limbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, she can get around that by creating multiple limbs so as to subdue larger people or move heavier objects, as she demonstrated during her fights against Yama and Oars, among others, but even then she has her limits, as she noted how heavy Yama was during her fight with him. The fruit itself doesn't make her any physically stronger, she just uses her powers creatively to make up for her weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="9497" Title="Is Digitamamon a parody of the tamagotchi?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Digimon Adventure (in both seasons), we meet Digitamamon, a profoundly evil, greedy digimon who looks like a giant egg with dinosaur legs and a crack in the shell where two yellow eyes stare out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Digimon (which preceded Pokemon) is based off a toy for boys that competed with the Tamagotchi toy. Tamagotchi is a egg-shaped toy featuring an egg that quickly hatches into an alien being.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tama-gotchi literally means egg-watch (with the second half being a transliteration of the English word 'watch')&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Digi-tama-mon breaks down to digital-egg-monster (with digi and mon being borrowed from English).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Digitamamon is one of the few digimon with the word 'digi' in its name, suggesting something digital, but it doesn't look digital at all. That's why I wonder if it's related to the Tamagotchi, the first 'digital egg'.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9499">&lt;p&gt;That's an interesting hypothesis, but I don't think it's right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Digimon enthusiast will recall, the eggs from which Digimon hatch are called "Digi-Eggs" in English. However, in Japanese, they are called "Digi-Tama" (&#12487;&#12472;&#12479;&#12510;), from which the English is basically directly translated, since &lt;em&gt;tama&lt;/em&gt; means "egg", as you pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems rather more likely that the name "Digitamamon" derives from "monster that is a Digi-Tama/Digi-Egg", rather than "digital monster that is a &lt;em&gt;tama&lt;/em&gt;/egg". The latter interpretation might suggest a connection to Tamagotchi, but is unlikely, since (as you pointed out) it doesn't look particularly digital at all. However, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; look a lot like a Digi-Tama/Digi-Egg - see below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIXXz.jpg" alt="a Digitamamon"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I think there still is a connection to the Tamagotchi in a different way: it's widely acknowledged that the Digimon product line is basically "Tamagotchi plus battles". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that both Digimon and Tamagotchi are Bandai products. It's thought that the Tamagotchi sold well among girls but not boys, leading Bandai to introduce Digimon to capture the other half of the market. As such, even if Digimon and Tamagotchi aren't explicitly referencing one another, it shouldn't be too surprising that they will have some features in common, being produced by the same company and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Digimon (which preceded Pok&#233;mon)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite. The chronology here is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 1996: Nintendo releases Pok&#233;mon Red and Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nov 1996: Bandai releases the first Tamagotchi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jun 1997: Bandai releases the first Digimon virtual pet device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pok&#233;mon anime (Apr 1997) also preceded the Digimon anime (Mar 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="52990">&lt;p&gt;Digimon didn't complete with Tamagotchi at all. They WERE Tamagotchis and by the same company, Bandai. Just a newer version or sideline that took on a life of its own. With that in mind, Digitamamom wouldn't be a parody but more likely a homage to its own other brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I am a fan of the Anime and its &lt;a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Card-game gameplay&lt;/a&gt;. I even attended Conventions here in our country where dual matches were held and participated by trading card enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27629">&lt;p&gt;I would say this is a fairly opinion-based question, since some people will say the anime is superior to the manga, while many others will say vice versa. I would say the manga is a better place to start; it is its most faithful form, without fillers and without card games shoehorned into every available opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that unlike the anime, the manga takes a while before focusing on card games. Also, in terms of the anime, there are two separate ones, the first made by Toei and the second made by Studio Gallop, though the second continues where the first lefts off. These follow the plot of the manga (although the Toei one is fairly loose about it.) though with noticeable differences (e.g. fillers). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the movies, the first one, simply titled "Yu-Gi-Oh!" Is based on the Toei adaptation. The Pyramid of Light movie is only possibly canon to the Gallop anime, and even then ambiguously so. It takes place shortly after the Battle City arc. "Bonds between time" is sort of commemorative, and it crosses over with GX and 5Ds; I do not recommend watching it before watching GX and 5Ds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the manga, there is also a short series called "Yu-Gi-Oh! R" which also takes place after the Battle City arc, and is also disputed in its canonicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other works, such as GX, 5Ds, Zexal and Arc-V, are, unlike the original, Anime first before manga, instead of the other way around. These certainly does not encompass the "original one" as you mentioned in your question.&lt;/p&gt;

While the ending of the manga is quite different to that of the anime, the very last scene is the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Satoru goes back to the spot under the bridge where he hid from the police, and as he hoped Airi shows up there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34345">&lt;p&gt;Based on  the anime and the manga, the last scene is Satoru going under the bridge where he hid with Airi after he was accused of murdering his mother. There he used his hands to form a rectangle, and as he saw through the rectangle, he saw Airi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no continuation of this story, but considering that Hinazuki Kayo ends up with one of their friends (Sugita Hiromi) and is living happily, it is implied that Satoru seeing Airi there means that his own love story will finally start (with Airi). It wasn't explicitly mentioned, so I believe it was intended to be left open to fans interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40150">&lt;p&gt;In this case, it remains to be seen. Airi does stand up for Satoru several times, but they never really are seen engaing in any actions that would quite sum up to a 'romance', more of a relationship built using mutual trust and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably takes place between episode 19 and 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Long version (spoilers)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; I was wondering about this as well. It clearly takes place after episode 15 when Rin reveals his powers, and after Konekomaru begins to accept him as a friend after episode 18 or 19. So I'd say it takes place before episode 20, because the next few episodes seem to happen concurrently and all are more serialized leading up to the finale. Also, Yukio doesn't have his pointy demon ears in the movie like he does in the after credits scenes of episode 25, so I don't think the movie takes place after the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40682">&lt;p&gt;It can't be after the series as Yukio isn't like he was at the end like how Rin is but Rin is known as the son of Satan now so I say anywhere from 19-20&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 24 of &lt;em&gt;JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders&lt;/em&gt;, Polnareff takes advantage of a dangerous situation to show off his knowledge of hand signals. A video of this can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRsXY1GYmSE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kakyoin recognises the hand signal as meaning &quot;Your underwear is showing&quot;, which greatly pleases Polnareff. The two of them share some kind of elaborate handshake to mark the occasion, the eyes of both characters being darkened (which, as far as I understand, usually indicates seriousness).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What on Earth is going on here? Why do Kakyoin and Polnareff know this, why is Polnareff so pleased and why do they share an elaborate hand shake afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="33549">&lt;p&gt;Polnareff knows this by virtue of him being Polnareff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the individual gestures and their 'translations' makes the sentence that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pan (Japanese sound for clapping) + 2 (two) + ok (maru) + seeing something (mieru) = pan-tsu (underwear) + maru (entire) + mieru (can see)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Kakyoin is able to decipher what he's trying to say, since NO ONE ELSE chimes in, and they both share a bonding moment. That bonding moment is the amazing handshake, and their eyes darken to reflect the solemnity of the bro-ment.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38414">&lt;p&gt;It's also a reference to another manga series called Dr. Slump, where another character does the same hand signal. So it could be a bro moment where Polnareff is basically going "Whoa, you got that reference? Yeeeesss, we read the same comic!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might also be worth noting that France loves manga, so it would make sense that Polnareff had read Dr. Slump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're correct, she is reading &#12450;&#12460;&#12472;&#12477; (&lt;em&gt;Agajiso&lt;/em&gt;) magazine. No doubt about that.&lt;/p&gt;

  Agajiso (Magazine?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, there's a magazine called... &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Magazine" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weekly Shonen Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&#36913;&#38291;&#23569;&#24180;&#12510;&#12460;&#12472;&#12531;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a Japanese word play involving similar kana substitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#12450;&#12460;&#12472;&#12477; (A -ga-ji-so)
&#12510;&#12460;&#12472;&#12531; (Ma-ga-ji- n)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#12510; (ma) and &#12450; (a) have the same top stroke and similar voicing (ending in -a)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#12477; (so) and &#12531; (n) are almost identical, and it's a popular character pair to be substituted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is, &lt;strong&gt;no, there's no &lt;em&gt;Agajiso&lt;/em&gt; magazine, but it seems to be a parody of &lt;em&gt;Magazine&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="8193" Title="Why did Jiraiya have to die?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Naruto, when Jiraiya fights Pain, he goes out of the barrier to confirm his suspicion about Pain (that all the 7 pains are dead) but he could have used a shadow clone instead. Shadow clones can transfer knowledge and experience (as told by Kakashi) and if Jiraiya had the chakra to maintain the barrier, swim when he is badly injured and then be alive just to write a message on the back of the toad (apparently I forgot the toad's name), he could have had the chakra to create a shadow clone. Why didn't he do so? [Why did he have die? I feel so sad about him :'( ]&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8250">&lt;p&gt;Jiraiya once said: "In the ninja world, it's not how you live. Rather, it's how you die." So I think he applied this quote in his final seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we can assume that he hadn't had enough chakra to escape from Pein (don't forget, he was stabbed a lot of times with Pein's chakra absorbing rods), so his last efforts were to send a message to Konoha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I'm quite sure he knew that this would boost Naruto, so practically Jiraiya sacrificed himself to make Naruto (maybe) the strongest shinobi in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, maybe he even knew that his body could be resurrected or used by Nagato as a host body, so he didn't even try to escape. Rather, he realized the seal of his body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Kishi had some reasons why to "kill" Jiraiya, but in my opinion, he had to go to make the later story happen.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="29901">&lt;p&gt;Another reason to why Jiraiya didn't use Kage Bunshin is because the nature of the jutsu itself. &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique#Overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kage Bunshin no Jutsu&lt;/a&gt; splits the chakra of the user equally. This is a risky move for him to perform considering that he is in the enemy territory, no backup and has no idea of the extend of Pain's powers. Suppose that after using Bunshin no Jutsu, Pain found not the Kage Bunshin, but the real him, he would be so screwed having to fight Pain with only half chakra. Having only half of his chakra would prevent him from using some of his jutsus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible reason is that there is a chakra link between the real and the Kage Bunshin as explained by Tobirama. &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3vd0I.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3vd0I.png" alt="Tobirama explaining principle of Kage Bunshin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that at that time, Jiraiya has a feeling that the Pain he fought are all dead bodies and that there is someone controlling them remotely. He opted not to use Kage Bunshin for he was afraid that were he to use it, Pain would be able to detect his whereabouts based on the chakra link. Also note that other than the experience the chakra from the Kage Bunshin is also transferred back to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the sound effects (&lt;a href="http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/browse/ira_ira/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ira ira&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) she's angry, and I can't really say why. My only guess is that it's a reference to the Negima manga; in the manga, Ako confesses her love to Negi when he's magically aged up to 16 and later suffers heartbreak when she finds out who he really is, so maybe she's offended that Nozomu is implying that she shouldn't have said anything. That's kind of a stretch, though.&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="31269" Title="How come a uniform can't be made of 40% to 90% life fibers?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that on Kill la Kill that Goku Uniforms can only be made from 10%, 20%, and 30% life fibers. But later on, it is revealed that a Kamui is made of 100% life fibers. That seems like a major gap to me. How come a uniform can't be made of 40%-90% life fibers?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31270">&lt;p&gt;No characters we see can wear 40%-90% life fiber uniforms who cannot also wear 100% life fiber uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only people who can wear 100% life fibers are not 100% humans (they have life fibers experimentally infused into their bodies).  No pure humans have been shown to be able to wear more than a 3 star uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31287">&lt;p&gt;Well, a normal person can not handle above 40% life fiber, even student council had pre-training to wear them and they are also selected few to wear 3 star regalia (above 30% to 40% life fiber) from the entire school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see what happened to people who wear 100% life fiber: it gives a huge amount of strain to their bodies. Remember when wearing Junketsu or Senketsu, Kiryuin Satsuki had to maintain great will power, discipline and great amount of physical strength. Even so, Kiryuin Satsuki can not gain the full benefit of Junketsu because she is just a human.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, generally, normal humans can not wear 100% life fiber, but if you keep on building up your physical and mental strength around long period of time, you might have a chance to wear one. Still, you won't get to have full power set or full benefits of it due to inhuman strain on your body.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;According to the Hero Association ratings, several characters have more power than Tatsumaki. Bang, Atomi Samurai, Flashy Flash and amazingly King are rated to have a power of 10 while Tatsumaki only has 9. But, Tatsumaki was capable of taking a monster who was probably a demon level in one blow. Why does the Hero Association ratings have several S Class Heroes to be more powerful than Tatsumaki?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53378">&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the translation of that stat as "Power" is a (slight) mistranslation.  I have seen it alternatively translated as "Instantaneous Power/Speed".  &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; we assume that is a more accurate translation, then it means it's a measure of how quickly they can utilize their power/speed. As such Tatsumaki's rating may be lower than max if it takes her a little bit more time to unleash her strength; at least as far as the association thinks/knows anyway.  Martial combatants like Atomic Samurai can use highly trained reflexes to react powerfully with little to no thought, while Tatsumaki, presumably, needs to actively think/concentrate for most situations.  This seems supported by an important plot point later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Espers must choose between offense and defense, as they can only use one power at a time.  This creates an exploitable gap where you can land an attack while the Esper is trying to attack. This pops up near the end of the Garou/Monster Association arc.  We are also told during that sequence that her barrier remains up and effective even when she's unconscious (and apparently concussed).  As such it seems to be Tatsumaki's default state to be in defensive mode, and she must consciously and actively switch to an offensive attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime seems to make a serious point about not revealing who the seventh one is.  I doubt it has been revealed yet in the manga.  That means the answer is we don't and can't know yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said the current "shichibukai" are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Law&lt;/li&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm considering reading &lt;em&gt;Hidan no Aria&lt;/em&gt; after watching the anime (a long time ago). I remember when the spinoff came instead of season two and was fairly disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does the manga continue with the same main characters?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48524">&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are more than 1 manga series: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidan no Aria&lt;/em&gt;: started as a light novel, got adapted into manga &amp;amp; anime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidan no Aria AA&lt;/em&gt;: started as spin-off manga, got adapted into anime &amp;amp; light novel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidan no Aria-chan&lt;/em&gt;: a 4-koma spin-off manga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to answer the question: &lt;strong&gt;yes, &lt;em&gt;Hidan no Aria&lt;/em&gt; manga continues from the anime, which is an adaptation to the original light novel&lt;/strong&gt;. The anime ends at volume 3 of the light novel, which is around volume 8-9 of the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="6688" Title="Is the FMA: Brotherhood movie considered canon?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been watching the FMA: Brotherhood Movie (Sacred Star of Milos), and from what I've read/what I can tell, it's set partway through the show. Is it considered canon, or is it more like the Naruto movies, where it is entirely separate from the storyline?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6691">&lt;p&gt;The script itself was not written by Hiromu Arakawa (nor did she have any staff involvement at all), and she has not endorsed it as part of canon (though she has said that she "[looked] forward to it"). Additionally, it was written after the main series had concluded, and intentionally placed in the timeline so that it would not interfere with the canon story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was it difficult to create a story that didn't mess up the plot-line of the show, since the show was already over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Since the film happened in a country that the characters had never gone to and didn't go back to for the rest of the series, it was difficult to conclude it in a way that didn't affect the rest of the existing story. But, having it in such a locale let us concentrate on the story without worrying about the affects on the rest of the series. Also, I had to be careful with how much Al fell for Julia because it could seriously affect what happens in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you put the story where you did in the timeline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;At this time, Ed has come to the realization that he was certain Al's body existed somewhere, and he was ready to jump on the next train to wherever he could go to make that happen. So, in that time period, it was the best time for them to travel to another location if they could find a clue to the recovery of their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2011/otakon/20"&gt;AnimeNewsNetwork Q&amp;amp;A with director Kazuya Murata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among fans, I've never found any that regard this movie as canon. As it was not the original creator's intent, nor created by her, it really has no reason to exist in canon (except that it's written in a way that doesn't &lt;em&gt;interfere&lt;/em&gt; with canon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all this, I think we can safely say that &lt;em&gt;Sacred Star of Milos&lt;/em&gt; is not officially part of the &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; canon.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, Itachi also had knowledge of his grudge against Konohagakure, which is why he confronted Obito/Tobi/Madara before the Uchiha clan massacre. However, Itachi never clearly states his knowledge of Obito's true identity, and also, Obito states during his first encounter with Sasuke that Itachi clearly knew more than he let on.

</answer><answer Id="50189">&lt;p&gt;Itachi is the one of the most smartest people in the anime. Itachi knew it about Obito, from Kakashi, when they was in one team in ANBU - The story of the Kakashi's Sharingan. Itachi knew it about the moment when Kakashi cut it off the hand of Deidara. All of Akatsuki knew u it about this situation...and if you think more about that, from the story from Kakashi about his Sharingan, Itachi is enough smart to known about Tobi true identity. He will understand That, if Kakashi have the same time space from Mangekyo Sharingan, like Obito, they have same eyes...or just Obito is Tobi. Itachi isn't foolish. Itachi was think about that things... That

I'd rather not watch the filler content and only watch the episodes which are directly related to the plot. To be clear, I'm defining a filler episode as one which is not based on any story in the manga or based on extra manga chapters which have nothing to do with the overarching story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which episodes are filler?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#10;This question is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3018/6166&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;. I was curious about this myself after completing the One Piece manga, but to keep uniformity between similar questions, I took the same wording as &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/24/logan-m&quot;&gt;Logan-M&lt;/a&gt; had used in his question about Bleach filler.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20094">&lt;p&gt;There seems to be alot less filler in One Piece than in Naruto or Bleach.

</answer></question><question Id="14061" Title="What is this anime that has a strange flying sun totem?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't think the one I watched is a full episode or something. It should be a trailer, and I assume it is an anime because I watched it on a VCD of a magazine about manga/anime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched it during 2000-2003 if I didn't remember it wrong. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the show is a 2000-2003 production. The magazine should be older than the month I watched it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The background of the anime seemed pretty dark. I remember a flying sun totem (not sure if it flew by itself or was the face of something else) appearing in different places and in each place there are characters fighting. And the character on the sun totem's side (I assume) always won and killed the other -- an invasion maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The flying sun totem looks a bit like this pic: abstract flare around the circle, and a face (but filled up the circle part in that anime).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wdt2zm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sun totem&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for giving unclear information about the anime.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is a dark, brooding place populated by humans, but ruled in reality by powerful beings known as the Darkstalkers, and there is constant conflict between them as they try to determine who is the most powerful of them all. Zombies, vampires, werewolves - all of them compete in contests of strength and sheer will to attain their own personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;All of this becomes moot when a race of Aztec robots called the Huitzil decide that humanity isn't worth saving, and start waging war on the world, while in the sky, a solar god from outer space plots the conquest of Earth. And the Darkstalkers must become unwilling allies in order to save the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun totem spits out Pyron, the boss of the series, who challenges every monster character and wins all battles until his defeat in the end. The background of the anime is pretty dark most of the time, as you can see in this screenshot of the sun totem:&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="485" Title="What constitutes as an Yin/Yang/Yinyang element technique?" Body="&lt;p&gt;As we know, the Naruto &quot;Table of the elements&quot; consists of more than just the basic 5.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of the combination elements, (Wood, Ice, etc), we also have the three rather bizarre Yin, Yang, and YinYang elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What are they? What can they do? Tobi explained that mastery over these elements allows one to basically become God, completely erasing the boundary between dream and reality. However, is that all there is to it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Second Mizukage states that genjutsu is basically Yin element, what does that make the Yang element?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, what is the YinYang element? Is &quot;God&quot; the only jutsu there?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What about elementless jutsus like Shadow Clone, do they constitute as either of the three?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="490">&lt;p&gt;This will only partly answer your question, but according to naruto wikia &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1oEFg.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yin relates to one's spiritual energy and Yang relates to one's
  physical energy and it's necessary to utilise both of these in order
  to mould chakra for ninjutsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thing that the phrase "become God" is used as a metaphor. According to the same wiki, the Sage of the Six Paths had absolute control over Yin and Yang, and was able to "make his fantasies come to life". This is described as &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Yin%E2%80%93Yang_Release" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The process he used is explained to have initially involved the
  administration of imagination, and the spiritual energy which forms
  the basis of Yin chakra to create shape and form from nothingness.
  Then, through the application of vitality, and the physical energy
  which forms the basis of Yang chakra, he would breathe life into the
  prior form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Second Mizukage states that genjutsu is basically Yin element, what does that make the Yang element?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, genjitsu is basically a subset of Yin release (&lt;em&gt;Inton&lt;/em&gt;, &#38512;&#36929;). Based on the fact that Yin relates to spirit energy, and Yang relates to physical energy, that makes perfect sense, because genjitsu techniques are basically illusions. According to the wiki again, the Yang release (&lt;em&gt;Y&#333;ton&lt;/em&gt;, &#38525;&#36929;) is "based on the physical energy that governs vitality" and  &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Creation_of_All_Things" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;can be used to breathe life into form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also the Yang part of the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra that was sealed within Naruto. This causes the Yang chakra to have impact on other techniques when Naruto is in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode - namely, the Wood Release technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also implied that the elemental-less techniques, have their source in Yin and Yang (this is from chapter 316):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="495">&lt;p&gt;Yin is spiritual energy and Yang is physical energy. You need to manipulate both spiritual and physical energy to mold jutsus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kirrq.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;page 11 of chapter 510&lt;/a&gt;, Tobi explains that by administering imagination, and the spiritual energy which forms the basis of 'yin' power... he would create shape and form from nothingness. By administering vitality, and the physical energy which forms the basis of 'yang' power... he would breathe life into that form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chakra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you are probably aware, a &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra#Normal_Chakra" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ninja's chakra&lt;/a&gt; is composed of a balanced mix of his spiritual and physical energy. These two components are Yin and Yang, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Jutsus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yin and Yang nature seem to be the basis for most jutsus that do use nature alteration, but are non-elemental (e.g. genjitsu). It seems that Chakra is formed when &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkI1g.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;combining&lt;/a&gt; spiritual and physical energy. Some people are more suited with one over the other, which might determine whether their balance of Yin and Yang naturally leans towards either side. Therefore not all jutsus require an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; balance of these two Yin and Yang. Instead varied proportions of the combined forces by different means based on the intent of the user determine the jitsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inton (Yin Release)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jutsu like genjutsu and the Yamanaka Clan's psychic jutsu are spiritual and which focus on the mind. So they must use Yin and Yang nature alteration, emphasizing the Yin. These all seem to be jutsu which focus on extending your own chakra to your opponent and connecting your mind (e.g., implanting an illusion) to theirs. Whether it&#8217;s to implant an illusion, read their mind, or project thoughts etc. This basically uses spiritual chakra as a manifestation of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youton (Yang Release)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jutsu like Shadow Clones, medical jutsu, and the Akimichi Clan's size jutsu are physical. They focus on manipulating physical substances or creating them from chakra. They must use Yin and Yang nature alteration, emphasizing the Yang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoton (Yang Release) creates life force. Inton (Yin Release) materializes imagination. Onmyoton/In'youton (Yin-Yang Release) is a combination of both Yinton and Yangton (you could say the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sage_of_the_Six_Paths" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sage of the Six Path&lt;/a&gt;'s unique application of this is a bloodline ability). It allows one to imagine something and materialize it without giving up anything but chakra. In other words, giving form to one's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin + Yang = Chakra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin = Spiritual Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang = Physical Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin Release = Uses spiritual energy extending the mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang Release = Uses physical energy extend the body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin-Yang Release = Yin Release + Yang Release&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="497">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yin element&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
The yin element techniques, the basis of imagination and spiritual energy, can be used to create form out of nothingness.&lt;br&gt;
During the Kyuubi attack on Konoha Minato used the Shiki Fuujin to seal the Yin half of the Kyuubi's chakra within the Shinigami.&lt;br&gt;
It is, as you (and the Second Mizukage) say, the basis of genjutsu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yang element:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The yang element techniques, the basis of vitality and physical energy, can be used to breathe life into form.&lt;br&gt;
During the Kyuubi attack on Konoha Minato sealed the Yang half of the Kyuubi's chakra within Naruto.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever Naruto is in &lt;em&gt;Kyuubi chakra mode&lt;/em&gt;, nearby Mokuton technique created trees react to the Yang element's live-giving properties and develop into full-grown mature trees in an instant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Yin-Yang element:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are a combination of the use of both elements described above. As Yin is related to the user's spiritual energy and Yang to the user's physical energy, it is necessary to use both of them in order to mold chakra to create Ninjutsu.&lt;br&gt;
Yamato explains in chapter 316 (page 9) that the manipulation of Yin and Yang is the source of non-elemental techniques such as the Kagemane no Jutsu, Baika no Jutsu, medical ninjutsu, genjutsu, etc.&lt;br&gt;
The Rikudou Sennin had such a mastery over these that he could use Yin to make his dreams take form and Yang to make his fantasies real. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tobi explained that mastery over these elements allows one to basically become God, completely erasing the boundary between dream and reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rikudou Sennin's possessed an ability called Banbutsu Souzou (Creation of All Things), with which he created the nine Bijuu, out of the Juubi's chakra. Quoting from the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Narutopedia" rel="nofollow"&gt;Naruto Wiki&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The process he used is explained to have initially involved the administration of imagination, and the spiritual energy which forms the basis of Yin chakra to create shape and form from nothingness. Then, through the application of vitality, and the physical energy which forms the basis of Yang chakra, he would breathe life into the prior form. Thus the Sage used this to split the Ten-Tails into nine separate beings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jutsu Izanagi is also derived from this ability.&lt;br&gt;
Also,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Madara has implied that Yin&#8211;Yang element was involved in the creation of White Zetsu and his clones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, by mastering these one can become God, since he will be able to put anything that he imagines into life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to answer your question regarding Kagebunshin no Jutsu and the like, I'd say that they do come from the mastery of the Yin-Yang element, since they are not produced by any of the basic chakra elements, and they are indeed a product of your imagination come to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Unlike SingerOfTheFall, I do not think that the "become God" phrase is just a metaphor. As far as we know, the world they live in may be the creation of someone who mastered Yin-Yang elements, thus being able to put the world they have imagined into life (somewhat like what Tobi wants to do with is Tsuki no Me plan (although I believe he needs to do his plan like so because he does not fully master Yin-Yang elements)). I believe that is the kind of power Tobi speaks of when he says "become God".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="3768" Title="Why is it hard to draw people running in animes?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Why is it so hard in many animes to draw people running?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mean even if the whole anime drawing is good, somehow when someone is running it feels so awkward. Their body movements don't look realistic. Sometimes people seem to be leaping or scrolling. Sometimes their steps seem to be longer than a normal human could walk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are exception of course, but they are so rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3770">&lt;p&gt;The walk cycle is considered to be one of the most basic aspects of animation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American animators and animation enthusiasts often times scorn the Japanese styles and methods of animation as lazy, while Japanese anime enthusiasts deride the American style as clunky or too comical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that you ask? The answer lies in how these countries distribute their budget and time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While American animation often times may seem lacking in it's attention to detail, it makes up for it the quality of their animation. American animation often times meticulous and original in how they animate motion, though sometimes content is reused cyclically, the animation is painstakingly frame by frame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Japanese anime uses a lot of shortcuts (to save budget and meet deadlines). Typically long scenes feature only the mouth of a character (and maybe other minor features like a waving hair or glittering eyes) moving during delivery of key information/dialog, or the short burst of motion of some character in some an action pose against an animated, cyclic, and stylized background (I'm looking at you transformation scenes). Often times these uses of dramatic still-shots are done against patterned (or static illustrated) backgrounds, sometimes a few moving emotive icons (sweat drops, question marks, small chibi animated heads) will accompany a some sort of monologue. Admittedly both styles of animation reuse shots and sequences, but it's more noticeable in Japanese anime for various reason (e.g., not enough budget and/or manpower). This is why Japanese anime is typically labeled as "lazy" by American animators and enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical walk cycle in animation consists of 8 keyframes typically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TRmJ3.gif" alt="22-keyframe animation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smoothness of an animation is typically determined by the framerate and amount of key frames in the animation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In American animation, the animation is captured by shooting two frames of film per drawing at a rate of 24 frames per second (fps) to achieve the smooth motion of American animation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese anime, while it also runs at an average 24 fps, typically captures their animation at a rate of three or four frames per drawing in order to save money and manpower. Though it varies depending on the studio and tools used (e.g 3DCG) with main objects in the foreground (typically characters) are animated at 8 to 12 fps, while background objects can be animated at as low as 6 to 8 fps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets compare the difference between one walk cycle that is 8 frame to one that is 16 frames, both at 60 fps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C9Ggm.gif" alt="8 frames per second"&gt; &amp;lt;-- 8 frames     &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ikz0y.gif" alt="16 frames per second"&gt; &amp;lt;-- 16 frames&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the 16 frame one is smoother, but slower while the 8 frame is faster, but choppier. This is because it takes the 16 frame animation twice as long, covering more frames, to go through one cycle than the 8 frame one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The varying of frame rates can also be be used to depict the expansion and compression of time (think bullet time from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;). However generally choppy animation is the result of not enough keyframes in your animation. More frames mean more and manpower and/or time, which ultimately means more money is required. Japanese anime production &lt;a href="http://wildgrounds.com/ask/15/anime-series-whats-the-average-budget" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;don't typically have as big of a budget&lt;/a&gt; compared to American productions (but there are exceptions), so they must make do with what they have and cut corners where they can (like Shaft did with the certain &lt;em&gt;Bakemonogatari&lt;/em&gt; TV episodes).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5997">&lt;p&gt;In the creation of Japanese animation, the director creates the storyboards (think of them as scenes) to assign to key animators. I'm mostly unsure where the blame lies, but I theorized that it's mostly on budget and time constraints. The key animators are good are making people run in a 2D plane (x, y dimensions). However, some might find it difficult to do it in a complex perspective assigned by the director. Additionally, the director hands a specific amount of frames that they have to accomplish it in so it won't break the overall timing/flow of next scene. In some instances, the key animator is successful, but the inbetweener makes it appear "off".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It mostly depends on the key animator. Toshiyuki Inoue, Mitsuo Iso, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Okiyura and Shinji Hashimoto were known as "realist" animators. Yoshinari Kandada pioneered the "Kanada" style. It's hard to describe what it exactly is, but it was prevalent in 80's mecha anime and in most Gainax anime. It's described as "spastic", or choppy looking. Despite Eastern animation favoring composition over animation, the fight/action choreography is hailed constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;When Shun became a Karmic Demon, he realized that his powers were always leaking and affecting the world around them, mutating animals such as sea slugs into &lt;a href=&quot;http://shinsekaiyori.wikia.com/wiki/False_Minoshiro#Forest_Minoshiro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Minoshiros&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Considering that the sign that a child has gained their powers is the presence of a Blessing Spirit, this would be an indication that their powers are already leaking at this point. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So does this mean the Blessing Spirit is just another mutant? If so, what creature was originally a basis, and did they all end up looking the same?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26691">&lt;p&gt;Blessing Spirits aren't &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; a physical thing. Rather, the agglomeration of bizarre phenomena that the people in the show describe as a "Blessing Spirit" is simply a subconscious/unconscious manifestation of the child's latent powers. To the uninformed observer, it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like what we might call a "poltergeist" - but as we know from the narrative, the real explanation doesn't entail a separate physical being causing the strange phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why they refer to it as though it were a physical being. Perhaps it's a fiction the adults maintain to keep the children from understanding the true nature of their powers and the damage that power leakage can cause? (Keep in mind that the students are never taught in school how karma demons &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; originate.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, this joke doesn't seem to happen like it does in the English version. While they do claim to have the &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; motto in Episode 86, their motto does not have the same tone the English version does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yamato&lt;/strong&gt;: If you ask us this or that...&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Kosaburou&lt;/strong&gt;: We usually don't respond&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Both&lt;/strong&gt;: But we'll make an exception this time and answer!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Yamato&lt;/strong&gt;: To prevent the destruction of the Earth!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Kosaburou&lt;/strong&gt;: To protect the peace of the Earth!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Yamato&lt;/strong&gt;: To stand by evil with love and sincerity!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Kosaburou&lt;/strong&gt;: The cute, mischievous villains!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Yamato&lt;/strong&gt;: Yamato!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Kosaburou&lt;/strong&gt;: Kosaburou!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Yamato&lt;/strong&gt;: The pair from Team Rocket soars through the universe!&lt;br&gt;

How can I say this without legitimate proof? Look at the numbers given for the 7 charts. They all resemble sizes in inches, if I am not mistaken, even those every country besides the U.S uses Centimeters. The further up or down the scales go, the closer the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34388">&lt;p&gt;As noted in the comments, the first two in particular are likely to be animation timings &amp;mdash; in particular, the first two (tagged 1-7 and 7-1, though the numbers on the latter actually run from 8 to 12 with the same number of internal markings as the first) illustrate the principles of &lt;em&gt;ease-out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ease-in&lt;/em&gt; ; motions should be slower at their start and finish than in the middle.  For a good brief tutorial on this, see e.g. &lt;a href="http://blog.digitaltutors.com/animation-body-mechanics-ease-in-and-ease-out/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://blog.digitaltutors.com/animation-body-mechanics-ease-in-and-ease-out/&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; it's one of the classic principles of animation and goes back to the very earliest days of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34405">&lt;p&gt;It looks like an inbetweening timing chart, very similar to the ones given in an example on a web page titled &lt;a href="http://www.brianlemay.com/Pages/animationschool/animation/lipsyncbook/timingcharts.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Timing Charts&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Lemay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bPa0p.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bPa0p.jpg" alt="Example animation timing charts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart in your question looks to be an example of what the is described in the picture above as a "halves slo-in" and "halves slo-out". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart shows how the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening" rel="noreferrer"&gt;inbetween&lt;/a&gt; frames that fill the gaps between key frames (like the one below the chart in your question) should be drawn.  The chart gives two alternatives, one using 5 inbetween frames between key frames on the left, and the other using 4 inbetween frames between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the alternative on the left, the chart is telling the inbetweener to first draw frame number 5.  This frame would be drawn halfway between two key frames, the one numbered 1 and 7 on the chart.  The inbetweener would then draw frames 4 and 6, the former halfway between frames 1 and 5 and the later halfway between 5 and 7.  Then frame 3 would be drawn, halfway between 1 and 4, and then frame 2. halfway between 1 and 3.  A similar process would be followed to draw frames 9, 8, 10, 11, and 13 in that order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the frames are displayed at a constant rate (probably "on twos" at 12 frames per second) the illusion of movement created by the animation would start off slow, speed up and then slow down again.  The total running time for the animated sequence would be (if done on twos) 1 second.&lt;/p&gt;

Isn't it noteworthy? I don't see any sources highlighting this ability of his (even in Wiki)!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26580">&lt;p&gt;I think it's a case of Zoro always being cautious and alert much like a Samurai as opposed to him subconsciously using haki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see evidence of this in Whiskey Peak where Zoro doesn't put his guard down against the villagers and ensures limits his drinking when the crew were partying which pays off when we find out they were bounty hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26648">&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Haki/Kenbunshoku_Haki" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;One Piece wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kenbunshoku Haki, also known as Mantra on Skypiea, is a form of Haki that allows the user to sense the presence of others, even if they are concealed from view or too far to see naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f83e8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f83e8.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the aura which is seen through Kenbunshoku Haki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The user can also use this Haki to predict an opponent's moves shortly before they make them, thereby making the attack much easier to evade with enough skill. This prediction appears to the user as an image or brief "premonition" of what the opponent will do in the user's mind's eye, and the damage the user will take if the attack actually "hits". It appears that the more killing intent the enemy has, the easier they are to predict. Although, more skilled users can predict future moves whether there are ambient murderous intents or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, Zoro detecting the change in climate can't be  a consequence of his Kenbunshoku Haki, because it's inanimate and has nothing to do with a living thing. It's not possible to detect the "aura" of climate either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though the power allows the user to predict most attacks, it can be circumvented by various means. It cannot predict inherently random attacks; for example, Luffy managed to bypass Enel's Mantra by bouncing his fists off a nearby wall, to prevent himself and thus Enel from knowing where they would land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Zoro sensing the halt of the ship in the Calm Belt, it's highly unlikely that it was his Kenbunshoku Haki as well because the Straw Hats had merely begun their journey then, and noone was aware of their Haki, or even unconsciously used it. Not to mention, the halting of their ship was not intentional (a result of the action of another living thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's more of Zoro keeping an eye out for changes in the surroundings than it being his Haki. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26660">&lt;p&gt;I do agree with Ashish Gupta's answer. Also would like to add some more points to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently Zoro is given a duty of Monitoring the surroundings, generally sits(or sleeps) on top of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;
This Duty, however was never announced. And shown to be shared by other strawhat members too. So not sure if he chose it himself or his team members acknowledged his ability. But the SHP team does depend on his observation skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ashish noted, it's definitely not an "Observation Haki" but could merely be a presence of mind and cautiousness, perhaps a sign of a true swordsman..&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the first episode of Nekomonogatari (Black), we see this drawing of Araragi during his conversation with his sister at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/sL6PV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Depiction of Araragi Koyomi.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The text here states, according to the subtitles (and reading the text right to left):&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;IT'LL WEAKEN ME AS A HUMAN (COLOUR ART WORK)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't imagine the actual text here to be particularly significant though.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In either case, this reminded me a lot of Chinese socialist posters used for propaganda, but I am not sure if &quot;interpretation&quot; is correct, given that I haven't really been exposed to anything similar from any other East Asian countries (namely Japan, in this case). Is my interpretation correct, or can this drawing of Araragi also be interpreted as a reference to some non-Chinese drawing style (perhaps of the variety used for propaganda in another country)?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9809">&lt;p&gt;While I have not seen this episode yet, let me chime in to confirm that this image looks awfully close to typical war propaganda posters. They do not have to be &lt;a href="http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2011/08/glorious-socialism-chinese-ladies-in.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; actually, &lt;a href="http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2010/08/propaganda-posters-of-world-war-two.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Russians looked the same, as did those by Western countries at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawing style was, as far as I know, mandated by the circumstance around the second world war, meaning they all look similar. The messages are also (maybe surprisingly) similar, as is the facial expression of energetically staring into the upwards, far distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text in the example given is Japanese, which I sadly cannot read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese and Russian as well as other socialist propaganda made particular use of red colors:&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="46245">&lt;p&gt;She seems very interested in Kaneki, so it seems very likely right away that she's someone in Aogiri. Moreover, it grows more and more suspicious as the season continues, especially when you notice that when she interviews Shinohara and Juuzou, she tries multiple times to ask about whether it would be possible to create a ghoul via the transplantation of organs and seems much too interested in the subject for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her interest in the subject makes sense if &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; she is the one-eyed owl, because as a half-ghoul, the one-eyed owl would try to dig into the past of another half-ghoul (i.e. Eyepatch), were one to show up. One-eyed owl would naturally be interested in the subject of half-ghouls, meaning Takatsuki fits the bill perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table-glass"&gt;Table-glass wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A legend says that the first known faceted glass was given as a present to Tsar Peter the Great from a glass-maker called Yefim Smolin, living in Vladimir Oblast. He boasted to Tsar that his glass couldn&#8217;t be broken. Tsar Peter liked the present, however, after drinking some alcoholic beverage from it, he said loudly Let the glass be! (Russian: &#1057;&#1090;&#1072;&#1082;&#1072;&#1085;&#1091; &#1073;&#1099;&#1090;&#1100;! - literally the glass be), &lt;strong&gt;threw the glass on the ground&lt;/strong&gt; and managed to break it. But Peter didn&#8217;t punish the glass-maker, and the production of such glasses continued. According to the legend, people present during this episode misinterpreted the Tsar&#8217;s words and thought that Peter called to &lt;strong&gt;break the glasses&lt;/strong&gt; (Russian: &#1057;&#1090;&#1072;&#1082;&#1072;&#1085;&#1099; &#1073;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100;! - literally beat glasses or break glasses), that&#8217;s how a tradition of breaking drinkware on certain occasions appeared in Russia. Glasses were broken after especially important toasts or just during the especially cheerful parties. Russian restaurants even held a special prices for breaking the glasses. Breaking of drinkware, or, in wider context, any tableware, is believed in Russia to bring luck and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="11403">&lt;p&gt;I'm sure Jon Lin is correct about the background, but here is a more in-universe answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As user1306322 stated in a comment, it's likely based on a ritual done before going into a battle you don't expect to return from. In episode 23, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;they toast again, but this time Satsuki says not to break the cups as that time they're not going to their deaths (in her words, approximately). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the assumption that when they toasted in this episode, they did not expect to return.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36803">&lt;p&gt;Another potential source, in addition to the above-mentioned sources and possibly influences by them, is earlier anime. Kill la Kill makes frequent direct and indirect references to earlier works, and this scene from a prominent 80's sci-fi anime could have been what they are referring to by breaking glasses (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egJDJ-ooENU" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egJDJ-ooENU&lt;/a&gt;). Admittedly, this is hardly the first instance of Germanophilia or Semitophilia in anime or Japanese culture in general and its sources could be earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="48841">&lt;p&gt;This is based upon many light novels that I have read. Typically the breaking of the glass after a toast denotes a finality to whatever you are toasting. If you toast before parting you don't expect to see each other again, if you post welcoming someone into your family it implies a permanence to that acceptance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also read in some that it is implied that "until this toast is undone (repair of the cups) this is permanent." So in this one story they break the cups at the beginning of a journey and repair them when them come home to toast again. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="53880">&lt;p&gt;Breaking of glasses occurs twice in the yakuza film Tokyo Drifter (Suzuki, 1966), once in the formal introductory ritual between Tetsu&#8217;s and the northern boss (actually a dish of sake); and in the final scene where&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Tetsuo breaks his oath of loyalty to his boss, symbolically crushing a wine glass in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

(For reference, in a flash back before he became a skeleton, the crew members ask him how his revive-revive devil fruit power works, to which he replies &quot;I'm not exactly sure, I haven't died yet, so I wouldn't know.&quot; -I'm paraphrasing of course)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28205">&lt;p&gt;From the manga/anime, we do not know how Brooke learned which devil fruit he had eaten, but we can safely speculate on different possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the answer in the possible &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5919/how-is-the-ability-of-a-devil-fruit-discovered"&gt;duplicate&lt;/a&gt; says, there is a "Devil Fruit Encyclopedia" which lists the names and abilities of the known devil fruits (the encyclopedia is not complete). Some devil fruits come with illustrations. This is how Blackbeard was able to identify the Yami Yami no Mi fruit and steal it from his nakama Thatch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the entry for Brook's  Yomi Yomi no Mi fruit was illustrated and therefore he knew what the fruit was before he ate it. However, note that this fruit is rather peculiar in that it does not grant any abilities while the user is still alive. Even though this is speculation, this may be the &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; fruit with that characteristic. Therefore, even if there were no illustrations, one could have identified his fruit by the ability it came with, or lack thereof. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; (After Kaine's comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 676, when the salamender Slime dies and turns into gas, the powers of the artificial devil fruit he had eaten are re-introduced in a nearby apple. That means that if a devil fruit user dies near another fruit, and that fruit changes shape, one can know which type of devil fruit it is based on the deceased user's powers.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="30736">&lt;p&gt;I think Brook did not know about the Devil Fruit and its powers. He ate it and was surprised at no apparent changes, so he accepted his fate as the hammer. (Couldn't swim for no apparent power gain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he was dead, his soul return to this world from the underworld and that was when he realized his Devil Fruit's abilities. So he return back to his body but he couldn't find it and his body was turned to skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of Naruto Shippuden season 4, the 9 tail's chakra left Sora's body and then Yamato said that it will try to seek a new host now. Who was that new host? Did the chakra in Sora come back to Naruto, the real host of the 9 tails?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38462">&lt;p&gt;Short version: He was just a filler character...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sora appears only in the Twelve Guardian Ninja arc of the anime. In the other arcs of the anime and in the manga he is not mentioned anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, as readers and viewers of Naruto, we don't know if Nine-Tail's chakra, that left Sora's body, found a new host or did come back to Naruto, the real host of the Nine-Tails.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="14884" Title="What killed Broly for good?" Body="&lt;p&gt;So in The Legendary Super Saiyan 2, Broly dies at the hands of a three-way Kamehameha, he got blasted into the sun, but was this just an unfortunate but cool event and he would have died at the hands of the powerful Kamehameha anyway, or, was it actually the heat of the sun that killed him?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14887">&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the fact that he's blasted and not disintegrated like Cell for example is the proof that the sun burned him to ashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would he have survived if the sun weren't there ? Well you can't be very close to the sun without dying anyway (radiations, burning~~) so the distance he made to reach the sun should have been enough to disintegrate him if the Kamehameha was enough to kill him. Conclusion: it was powerful but only enough to restrict his movements and push him into the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a common name for any village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described in &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Anbu" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ANBU wikia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ANBU are covert operatives dispatched by their Kage. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Anbu are recruited from their village's standard shinobi forces, hand-picked by their Kage for their individual capabilities and special skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described in &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Anbu#Uniform" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ANBU's uniform&lt;/a&gt;, the outfit are different but not what they are called. It is more like Kage which like post or title.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="53462" Title="In Sword Art Online, is Kazuto (Kirito) Suguha's cousin, or is he adopted from unrelated parents?" Body="&lt;p&gt;It's mentioned multiple times that Kazuto is Suguha's cousin, not her brother. However, the key conversation in question seems to imply that the explanation was made up on the spot. To me, it seemed as though that was best alternative Kazuto's mom could come up when Kazuto confronted her unexpectedly; in reality he's really adopted from unknown parents. I couldn't find a good clip of it, so here's the clip in a reaction video, which is close enough: &#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/X8DD3tMzrsg?t=1239&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/X8DD3tMzrsg?t=1239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in s1 ep15 Suguha mentions that she and Kazuto look nothing alike. To me, that was included to specifically suggest that they're unrelated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I'm relying on the english dubbed version and I've never read the Manga, so I was hoping there was more in the original sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53463">&lt;p&gt;According to the light novels they are cousins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kirigaya Minetaka and Midori, husband and wife&#8217;s own child was
  Suguha, while Kazuto was Midori&#8217;s sister&#8217;s, this meant that he was the
  child of Suguha&#8217;s aunt. Her aunt and her husband, without a choice, left
  their only child, who was not even a year old, and passed away in an
  accident. The serious nature of the injuries they bared eventually
  putting an end to their lives, and Midori was left to take charge of
  Kazuto.&lt;br&gt;
  That fact was told to Suguha by both her parents during winter
  two years ago, around that time, Kazuto was trapped in a virtual reality
  game, going by the name of &#171;Sword Art Online&#187;. Suguha who had
  already received a big shock from the incident, was in a cruel state of
  confusion; she went to Midori, asking why she did not tell her earlier
  and why she was the only one not being told, and took out her
  confusion on Midori.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit earlier it is stated that his parents were surprised when Kazuto asked after his real parents so I find it unlikely that they would have lied to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#8220;... Even now, I recall that incident like it happened yesterday.
  That time when Minetaka-san and I were watching a movie in the
  living room, and Kazuto suddenly said from behind, &#8216;Please tell me
  about my real parents&#8217; &#8220;.&lt;br&gt;
  Suguha motionlessly gazed at Midori&#8217;s charming lips with very
  light rouge, a light nostalgic bitter smile appearing on them.&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;At that time, I was really surprised. Kazuto was only 10 years old.
  Till Suguha entered high school... it was a secret that we had planned to
  keep for 7 more years, but he found out about his Juki Net&#8217;s erase
  records.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both excerpts are from the prologue of the third light novel &lt;em&gt;Fairy Dance&lt;/em&gt; (translations by Baka-Tsuki).&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="13174" Title="What was Doi really thinking about Shuichi?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the end of episode 11 when Shuichi walks home from school with Doi again, Shuichi tells that he hates Doi and leaves alone. Doi just stands there for a moment looking shocked and then angrily kicks the fence shouting &quot;Damn!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There isn't much up until then to definitely say what kind of guy Doi is, but it's known that he once read Shuichi's diary note out loud to someone once (not sure exactly when and to whom), for which Shuichi might hold a grudge against him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the thing I'm curious about is why Doi was so emotional about that fence kicking after Shuichi said he hates him. I mean what did he expect if he really was bullying him? Or if he didn't do it to make fun of Shuichi then what, did he want to be friends with him and he just got very upset that Shuichi hated him for what he's done? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also from episode 12:&#10;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoxfY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Shuichi can't tell either way too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27606">&lt;p&gt;Most of this answer is implied, because it is not directly shown or stated. Also my answer is drawn from the manga, because I haven't watched the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My impression is Doi is a bit of a jock and was a bit of a bully when they were younger. The incident long ago was that he read out a shared diary of Shuichi and Yoshino Takatsuki, detailing their cross-dressing experiences, out loud to everyone present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the manga &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wandering_Son_chapters" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Vol 8&lt;/a&gt; quoted from the wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shuichi and his friends start their second year as junior high students, but everyone is split up between several classes. Anna tells Shuichi that he is an interesting person, even though he likes dressing like a girl. Shinpei Doi, Shuichi's classmate, sees him coming out of a restaurant with Yuki and his opinion of Shuichi changes; Doi wants to finally become friends with him. Anna and Shuichi, dressed as a girl, go out on a date, and run into Yoshino and Saori in a restaurant. The four go to a karaoke bar and have fun, though not without some tension between Saori and Anna. Yoshino decides to go to school in a boys uniform, and garners some attention from the teachers and other students. Doi contacts Shuichi, saying he wants to meet Yuki, so Shuichi goes with Yoshino and Doi to Yuki's place, who introduces herself as a transvestite living with another man (Shiina). Doi is surprised about Yuki, and even gets Shuichi to dress up like a girl in front of him. Doi suggests to Shuichi that he come to school dressed as a girl, since even Yoshino is dressing like a boy now. Shuichi thinks about this deeply, and even consults Chizuru and Yoshino about it. In the end, Shuichi knows he has to be the one to decide, and he comes to school wearing a wig and the old female school uniform Yoshino gave him. Everyone is surprised about this turn of events, and Shuichi is soon taken home early by his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first Doi is interested to befriend Shuichi only as a bridge to Yuki, whom eventually stops him short from confessing by way of introducing her boyfriend and thus he only states that she is "very pretty" upon meeting her. The fact that Yuki used to be a guy is a shock to him, "I never knew a guy could be such a beauty. I don't get it at all." Then, Doi turns and, clearly showing Shiuchi in this panel and muses "I wonder if he's like that too."
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8HFru.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8HFru.jpg" alt="Meeting Yuki"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhJud.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JhJud.jpg" alt="Pondering about Shuichi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already knowing that Shuichi used to cross-dress (he is unsure that he still does), Doi asks him upfront and Shuichi confirms this, leading Doi to ponder and this is clearly stated in the manga. And then he encourages Shuichi to turn up at school dressed as a girl. Shuichi eventually does so and the incident passes. Doi scoffs at Shuichi upon meeting him when Shuichi finally returns to school (in front of others, I guess to preserve his image) that he was a "stupid".

&lt;p&gt;However, Doi persues Shuichi after school to encourage him at several points to cross-dress, saying that he looks cute when he does. This hot-cold attitude confuses Shuichi and makes him lash out at Doi resulting in the scene you describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEVkV.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEVkV.jpg" alt="Trying to convince Shuichi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My read is that Doi himself is confused, but wants to see more of Shuichi as a girl, for his own reasons. Perhaps he wants to better know how he feels, or perhaps he is really quite interested, but this was never explored. Him "kicking the fence" (or some cans near a drink machine in the manga), is just frustration after trying hard to convince Shuichi to do it again, just not at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frustration could be a whole range of things, such as the possibility that Shuichi doesn't trust him anymore after what happened, to simply wanting to try out that relationship (and Shuichi saying he hated him makes that relationship seem hard to achieve). Again this was not fully explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can tell Doi is interested at looking at Shuichi dress up as a girl, perhaps hoping Shuichi grows up to be a Yuki one day.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="29058" Title="What is &quot;digi-paint&quot;?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was reading some reviews of this season's new shows, and I somehow happened to run across references to &quot;digi-paint&quot; twice(!):&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;The raw mechanics of producing anime can be a pretty frustrating thing sometimes. Back in the early 00s, technology shifts prompted the move to &lt;strong&gt;digipaint&lt;/strong&gt; from traditional cells, and early adopters of the new system suffered heavily for it. Shows like Haibane Renmei had fundamentally gorgeous art design, but looked smudged and indistinct due to the new technology. &lt;sub&gt;(from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/.97400&quot;&gt;BBK/BRNK - The Winter 2016 Anime Preview Guide&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;So this is a forgotten &lt;strong&gt;digi-paint&lt;/strong&gt; show that was dug up in a time capsule from no later than the year of our lord 2002, dusted off, reformatted into 16:9, and re-sold as an adaptation of a Masamune Shirow manga from 2010. How else do you explain its hideous color palette, jagged flat designs, and painfully dated obsession with fetishes of yesteryear like catgirls, maids, androids/cyborgs with unusually sexual hardware, and busty scientist onee-samas? &lt;sub&gt;(from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/.97359&quot;&gt;Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn - The Winter 2016 Anime Preview Guide&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &quot;get&quot; what they're talking about: that sort of crappy look that post-cel early-2000s shows almost invariably have. But I'm not sure what digi-paint actually is. Aside from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2014-04-11&quot;&gt;another post on ANN&lt;/a&gt; that refers to (but does not describe) digi-paint, I haven't managed to google up anything relevant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is digi-paint? When did it come into use (was it immediately post-cel?), and what is used nowadays instead?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29060">&lt;p&gt;I have a general idea of what digipaint is, but I couldn't find a lot of the sources that gave me this idea since it was mostly stuff I just picked up in passing. I did find &lt;a href="https://washiblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/anime-production-detailed-guide-to-how-anime-is-made-and-the-talent-behind-it/" rel="nofollow"&gt;one blog&lt;/a&gt; that went over the process and more or less confirmed what I had thought; scroll way down to 'Compositing / "filming"' to see where they discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the gist. Up until about 1999&amp;ndash;2000, anime was created by drawing line art on a clear plastic cel, then hand-painting that cel, with a brush. Characters and backgrounds were drawn on separate cels; character cels were placed on top of background cels and the animators would take pictures of each frame, stringing them together into a film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime around 2000, animators started coloring the line art using a computer. This is basically similar to making art in Photoshop, though according to the blog they use a program called RETAS! Pro. Backgrounds can easily be drawn separately and added later on a computer; if you've ever used Photoshop, you know how easy it would be to draw a character and a background as separate images and combine them later as layers of a single image. The filming process also started to be done on a computer; the animators create the frames digitally based on the line art, then use the computer to string the frames together into a "film". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digipaint refers to this process of coloring a cel on a computer with a program instead of by hand with a brush and paint. The blog and &lt;a href="http://animetics.net/2013/08/17/3-major-anime-industry-sea-changes-explained-by-their-effect-on-tv-anime-part-2-digital-paint-and-dvds/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this other one&lt;/a&gt; discuss some of the effects the new process had on the anime industry: since it was faster and easier to color frames and composite character and background art on a computer, shows could have more frames, which led to smoother animation that wasn't reused nearly as often. It was easier to add fine details, so character art became more detailed. (I assume this was because of zooming and the precision of a graphics tablet, plus the ability to undo mistakes.) It was also easy to add in 3D computer graphics, so things like special effects and machinery, which are much easier to create with CG than hand drawing, started to be done in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it took a while for animators and art directors to get used to the different character of digipaint compared to traditional paint, which led to the ugly color palettes, blurriness, and flatness that you see in a lot of early digipaint shows (from 1999&amp;ndash;2004 or so). These problems are especially noticeable in some of the lower budget hentai from this era, where characters and background art look like they exist on two separate 2D planes rather than in a single 3D space, making the animation resemble a paper cutout puppet show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, digipaint is still commonly used today; animators have just gotten a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better at using it. &lt;em&gt;Last Exile&lt;/em&gt; is another show from the early era that I remembered looking a lot better than it did. Like &lt;em&gt;Haibane Renmei&lt;/em&gt;, it was a show with amazing, imaginative visuals that ended up looking like hell because of a hideous color palette, rampant blurriness, and primitive CG integrated poorly with the 2D animation. I haven't watched &lt;em&gt;Fam: The Silver Wing&lt;/em&gt;, but it would surprise me if it didn't look &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than the original. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some shows have &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-01-13/.97503" rel="nofollow"&gt;moved towards cel-shaded 3D animation&lt;/a&gt;. This is a technique where everything in the show is created in 3D CG, but through the use of filters and such, it almost kinda sorta ends up looking like traditional 2D animation. Cel-shaded 3D has been around for a while in video games, but it's just now in its early days for anime and suffering from problems just like early digipaint. However, it will probably end up replacing digipaint, since it's cheaper (just render a 3D model from different angles. It's almost like having actors again!) and getting better all the time. (Cf. &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/arpeggio-of-blue-steel" rel="nofollow"&gt;Arpeggio of Blue Steel&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Digital painting is a method of creating an art object (painting) digitally and/or a technique for making digital art in the computer. As a method of creating an art object, it adapts traditional painting medium such as acrylic paint, oils, ink, watercolor, etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as woven canvas cloth, paper, polyester etc. by means of computer software driving industrial robotic or office machinery (printers). As a technique, it refers to a computer graphics software program that uses a virtual canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer, and which give a digital artwork a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way.&lt;/p&gt;

I hardly read the manga but I'm very curious as to how humans become titans. Is it by some kind of drug similar to the one Eren was injected with by his father?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23796">&lt;p&gt;This contains major unmarked spoilers if you've only watched the anime, as will the linked questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Eren's case, it's through a particular serum that his father injected into him just after the fall of Shiganshina, shown in chapter 71 of the manga. This serum was stolen from the &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Reiss_family" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;true royal family&lt;/a&gt; by Eren's father, and is used to allow the subject to turn into a titan. As well as Eren, Rod Reiss is also shown as being able to transform after he has some of the serum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"...he himself scrounges the fluid off the floor[...]. After ingesting it, he turns into a gigantic Titan considered by Levi and Armin to be bigger than the Colossal Titan."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Rod_Reiss#Story" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Rod Reiss&lt;/a&gt; on the SnK Wiki&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain humans that are also 'titan shifters' seem to have this ability inherently, or at the very least, it hasn't been covered as to where they gained it - this includes the likes of Annie, Reiner and Bertholt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if a titan shifter is eaten, a titan with a human inside will gain the ability to shift between two forms. This is evident in the case of Ymir, discussed in &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/17210/how-does-ymir-turn-back-into-her-human-form"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to start with the beginning, start with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

Many people haven't seen &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; and yet they understand most of what follows it without watching &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Z Kai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; counts exactly as a "reboot", but it is a modified version of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Z&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in HD, with new color, new lines, new backgrounds, re-recorded voices and sound effects, new openings and endings, new background music, deleted scenes and episodes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The series takes place in a post-apocalyptic future of Earth, focusing on the aftermath of a global ecological disaster. The apparent cause of this travesty was rapid climate change due to a string of explosions in methane hydrate reserves. Occuring during the second half of the 21st century, the impromptu detonations succeeded in wiping out 85% of the planet's Human population.  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In order to survive, the remaining Humans made 300 Proxies in an event known as the Proxy Project and charged them with the creation of another Human race; they were to be nurtured within Dome Cities of the Proxies' establishment. These sealed off communities contained a birthing system called the WombSys as well as AutoReivs, two factors intended to aid and propagate the fledgling species. Once the Proxies were sent forth, the original Humans left Earth for another planet, biding their time until they were certain that Earth was safe for both Human races to settle. Their purpose completed, the then obsolete Proxies would have their immortal Amrita Cells destroyed by the emerging sun's deadly rays, unable to live under blue skies and therefore stamped out as relics of the past.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, it does take place on earth/in our world following a post-apocalyptic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yachiru suddenly appears out of nowhere and says to Kenpachi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Silly goose, if you would just use me properly, there wouldn't be anyone you wouldn't be able to cut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then touches him, which causes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; him to get a power boost, which he wonders about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ends the exchange with explaining to him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; That power is what everyone's been calling "Bankai".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these suggest the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Yachiru is Kenpachi's Bankai. He is unable to call out his Bankai anymore (he was never able to, consciously - the original appearance may have happened subconsciously), therefore, Yachiru is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Yachiru is his Zanpaktou spirit, again, one he has never been able to consciously communicate with. Though, I can't explain her disappearance if that were the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36275">&lt;p&gt;Short answer: Yachiru is with Kenpachi; as his Zanpakutou's personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot cite manga pages and chapters but if you follow the story, you should remember these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yachiru has always been beside or around Kenpachi as a human. Kenpachi's Zanpakutou has never had a name. There was once when Kenpachi lay on the ground trying to ask his Zanpakutou what its name was; no response. Kenpachi's mode of fighting has been brutal which damages his sword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to Yhwach's arc as Soul King, Yachiru makes Kenpachi know that the power he feels is what others call Bankai. This is after she fused with his Zanpakutou. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Kenpachi would now be able to call out his Zanpakutou and her name would Yachiru.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36832">&lt;p&gt;Yachiru is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Kenpachi's Zanpakuto or the spirit of his Zanpakuto. She is a Shinigami who has her &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; Zanpakuto as shown in her battle against Gremmy 'the Quincy who could make things he imagined real'. She is a soul from Kasajishi district of Rukongai. She may or may not have been near Kenpachi before he gained his Bankai as she disappeared immediately after seeing Kenpachi slice the meteorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reasons I have for Kenpachi seeing Yachiru before releasing his Bankai are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He may have only imagined her, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His Zanpakuto might have taken the form of Yachiru as she is the only one Kenpachi ever listens to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41878">&lt;p&gt;It would most likely because that she is a Zanpakuto who had split herself and physically manifested as a spirit. Kenpachi and Coyote Starrk are similar as they have their souls/powers split resulting in Yachiru and Lilynette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many people who already mentioned it, when Yachiru disappeared, she most likely fused back into Kenpachi's Zanpakuto just like Starrk did with Lilynette.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42775">&lt;p&gt;I think Yachiru is a physical manifestation of Zaraki's power. When Gremmy said that "he would imagine a world without imagination", Yachiru also vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44419">&lt;p&gt;Yachiru was Zaraki's true spirit. As for Nozarashi, it was the Zanpakuto of a dead Shinigami that Zaraki took the sword from. It's explained by &#332;etsu Nimaiya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that Zanpakuto's real name is Asauchi. If he dies there, Zanpakuto and the spirit inside still reside there. So, Zaraki had two spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;We already saw &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Vegita break out of the bottle when he was sealed with Mafuba.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it is not a definite technique to get rid of powerful foe.&lt;br&gt;&#10;My question is that, can Jiren be sealed even for a moment so they can toss him out of the field? Or is he simply too powerful to be effected by Mafuba?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43175">&lt;p&gt;Master Roshi freed Vegeta from the container by direction his "missed" attack towards the container. Vegeta was in his super saiyan blue form, but was able to get free &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; master roshi broke the seal from outside. Meaning it is strong enough to at least hold a super saiyan god captive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know that Zamasu was &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; able to break free because Goku forgot the seals for the container. Zamasu was strong enough to kill all the gods. This basically means that someone stronger than the gods can be sealed as well when sealed properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up, yes Jiren can be sealed. Mafuba has no limits as it forces an entity into the container. The only way to get out of it is by breaking the seal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Containment_Wave" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Click here for more info about the Mafuba.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43179">&lt;p&gt;There isnt any official data to say yes or no. There are arguments to sustain it could or it couldnt. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why it could: as you mentioned Vegeta was sealed in the jar and if it wasnt for Roshi's small kamehamehameha wave, he wouldnt have been freed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why it couldnt: Hit tried to inmobilize Jiren with a technique of his own which is a "time cage" and Jiren broke it. It would seem in Dragon Ball any trapping technique can be broken with enough power, other example is Kale breaking the Cocotte zone that traps the victim in another dimension, and as far as we know Jiren's power seems to be much greater than Vegeta by now. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43219">&lt;p&gt;I see there have been pretty good answers for the same however, I would like to differ and say No. 
This would be my explanation for the same.
&lt;li&gt; Jiren is at the level of a God of destruction. His power could possibly even surpass a few Gods of destructions(Like Vermouth, Beerus etc). &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The two times we've seen Jiren fight as of now is against Goku and Hit where he didn't even go all out and didn't even show any signs of tiredness or him being exhausted after these 2 fights.
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, we need to note that the mafuba way can be deflected and since you're referring to dragon ball super, I'm gonna refer to Frost who easily deflects Roshi's mafuba the second time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was noted by Vados that Jiren is a fighter who never lets his guard down. This is seen when he dodges UI Goku's kick which Toppo and someone as fast as Dyspo didn't even see coming. Also when hit attacked him once he knocked out goku, we see Jiren immediately react and block it. Jiren's reaction time is near to perfect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jiren was able to fight UI Goku when every part of Goku's body was acting on his own. Even at the same time, Jiren wasn't even fighting at full strength and seemed pretty heavily suppressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even during Hit, unlike goku who took a while to adapt to time skip. Jiren didn't take a single hit from time skip even from the start he was able to keep his guard and block and strike Hit. Once he adapted, he was perfect. Even when Hit created a shadow clone and tried to attack Jiren, we see Jiren immediately react and block it. Even when Hit used an attack which binds Jiren in a cage of time which completely inhibits movement, we see him effortlessly break out of it and block hit's attack with just his eyes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; He effortlessly controlled and pushed back a spirit bomb from SSJB + Kaioken *20 goku with just his eyes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We also see Jiren effortlessly block hit's invisible shockwave, which is known for killing fighters with a single hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every attack has its limitations and I strongly believe the mafuba wouldn't be effective against someone as strong as a god of destruction. As of now we know the mafuba is strong enough to contain SSJB Vegeta. However, Jiren's power is way beyond Vegeta's. Based on his display of power in his fights with Goku and Hit , I believe it can be concluded with certainty that this technique wouldn't work against someone like Jiren.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of 3 possibilities might happen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wave might not be strong enough to contain Jiren's power&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jiren might deflect the wave&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jiren would end up dodging it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="29020" Title="What is a Tokyo Raven?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't recall the title of &lt;i&gt;Tokyo Ravens&lt;/i&gt; being explained over the course of the anime (though it's possible I missed something). Other than the Raven Coat, I don't remember any particular references to ravens. Where does the term Tokyo Raven come from and what does it mean? Is there a historical basis for it or is it something the author made up? Is it explained in the light novels?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29023">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where does the term Tokyo Raven come from and what does it mean? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correct parse is almost surely &lt;code&gt;Tokyo [Ravens]&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;[Tokyo Raven]s&lt;/code&gt;. As in "ravens in Tokyo"; not "more than one of a Tokyo Raven". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But what ravens?" you might ask. "I sure didn't see any in the anime!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is it explained in the light novels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep. It turns out that the light novel adorns a number of phrases with the furigana &#12524;&#12452;&#12532;&#12531;&#12474; "ravens". For example, from the back cover of the first volume (to use the most obvious example, since I don't have this OCR'd and hence can't Ctrl+F through it), there are already two distinct instances of this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&#38512;&#38525;&#24107;&#12383;&#12385;]&#12304;&#12524;&#12452;&#12532;&#12531;&#12474;&#12305; ("shamans" or something, depending on your translation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&#38343;&#12395;&#33310;&#12358;&#40201;&#12383;&#12385;]&#12304;&#12524;&#12452;&#12532;&#12531;&#12474;&#12305; ("crows who dart through the darkness"). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's not a one-to-one equivalent of this practice in English, but a reasonable approach is to understand it as "ravens" being used as metonymy for "shamans"/etc. And this is true in-universe, too: shamans are sometimes referred to or described as "ravens" because of their tendency to don black, raven-like cloaks, as Yakou did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This furigana thing occurs multiple times in the actual body text of the LN (in volume 1, at least), but it'd take me a while to hunt down the actual quotes. There are also direct (non-furigana) uses of "ravens" (&#40201;) as metonymy for shamans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many shamans (i.e. ravens) in Tokyo; and many "crows who dart through the darkness" (i.e. ravens), if by "crows" we mean "weird shadowy supernatural things". Hence, &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Ravens&lt;/em&gt; - ravens in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But your confusion is reasonable: this would probably be lost on people who have only seen the anime, since the furigana double-meaning thing obviously doesn't work with the spoken word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there a historical basis for it or is it something the author made up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know very little about real-world onmyoudou, but I'm not aware of the raven being a motif or symbol there. (Of course, research is made difficult by the fact that &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Ravens&lt;/em&gt; itself pollutes google results for this sort of thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="17230" Title="Why didn't Annie kill Armin during the 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I watched the anime and couldn't find a explanation as to why Annie spared Armin's life?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="19694">&lt;p&gt;Why would she?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie, at least in her mind, is not a villain. She may be an antagonist to the main characters in the Anime, but she does not think of herself as a villain. She does not think of herself as evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would not benefit in the least from killing Armin. The only members of the expedition she killed were the ones that threatened her titan form. She trained alongside them, and even had formed bonds of friendship with some of them. Even the explorer corps members were at a discomfort dealing with her, after learning what she did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her main goal was to get Eren and deliver him to her masters/employers (it is still unclear who charged her with the kidnapping in the manga - as of chapter 66).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, her reasons for not killing Armin may be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armin was harmless. His vertical maneuvering skills were poor, and even if he were to attack her titan form, she would easily squat him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She does not think of herself as a monster&lt;/strong&gt;, or even that she is evil, so she has zero motivation for random killing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More on her self-image, she is clearly a human that can change into titan (in contrast to Ymir who was a titan for 60 years before gaining the power of shifting). She has a good life with the MP Brigade. She is not a psychopath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She may have some feelings of friendship or camaraderie towards Armin. Remember Armin has a very likeable personality. He gets along well with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Annie_Leonhart" rel="noreferrer"&gt;her personality&lt;/a&gt;, Shingeki no Kyojin Wiki says: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet, she somehow does seem to hold a strange fascination and even feelings of respect towards people that have a deep sense of duty and righteousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it seems to me that Armin falls under that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe killing Armin at that time would take more time than just confirming he is not Eren, and she is in a hurry to complete her goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armin was not alone. Killing him (remember that people actually LIKE Armin) could usher the other explorer corps around into a battle-frenzy to avenge his companion (maybe not likely, but who knows).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons for killing Armin at that moment? Can't think of any.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35909">&lt;p&gt;She is not a ruthless killing machine. She has a goal in mind along with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Berthold and Reiner, which is not yet fully revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE MANGA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Reiner was present with Armin. If she killed Armin she would have to kill Reiner as well because it would look extremely suspicious that Reiner got out of the fight alive while Armin died (since Reiner is physically superior and he would have to fight until the end if one of his companions is being attacked) BTW, Reiner is the Armored Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the above point: &lt;em&gt;she does have compassion for her friends (as long as that does not conflict with her ultimate goal)&lt;/em&gt;. When looking into Armin's scared face, she hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, I do not think Annie spared his life &lt;strong&gt;because Armin was weak&lt;/strong&gt;. She has killed a lot of other weak members. The only two reasons that &lt;strong&gt;I strongly believe&lt;/strong&gt; she did not kill Armin are the above.&lt;/p&gt;

All might in his past was always a big buff guy thanks to his training. He never had a "skinny form" his muscle form is how he used to look always before AFO injured him. As all might said to deku, he wasted away from his surgeries and complications. When he uses his quirk his body transforms to its former prime to handle the power. As for why he can still do that form for brief moments may be for comedy purposes or maybe the quirk doesn't fully leave the host after passing it on.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6WbD1.jpg" alt="Ed and Al, under lanternlight, studying alchemy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a young age, Edward and Alphonse Elric were exposed to alchemy, especially as their father had been a brilliant alchemist and left a gargantuan collection of books behind for the kids to read. This, however, was in addition to their already curious minds and their&amp;mdash;especially Ed's&amp;mdash;prodigal level of skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, Edward (and later Alphonse, upon recovering lost memories) witnessed the realm beyond the Gate of Truth, wherein he absorbed a large amount of further knowledge about alchemy. He also underwent training from one of the most intelligent, brutal, and experienced trainers known to the universe: Izumi Curtis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, Ed and Al were able to receive knowledge, training, experience, and an exposure to the infinite reaches of alchemy, prior to the main storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can contrast this further with the "normal" alchemists (that is, those who don't work for the military); the fact that we only hear of a couple who do not work for the military is a testament to how unsuccessful people have been at achieving a high level of skill with it. Keep in mind that alchemy involves the makeup of the entire world; from rock to air to water to human flesh, everything is composed differently, and specializing in more than one of these is a challenge at best. (Think of someone like Mustang who knows the basics of alchemy as well as flame alchemy, or Shou Tucker, who specialized in biochemical alchemy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some very rare cases, alchemy can be inbred. In the case of the Dwarf in the Flask, he &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/5186/274"&gt;was more-or-less created from alchemical knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, and thus understood it very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But none of this means that alchemy is limited to only certain people.&lt;/em&gt; As I paraphrased above, some people are naturally more talented at some things: Some are better at creative tasks, some better at math, history, and so on. In the universe of &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, alchemy is just another one of these skills that requires thousands of hours of work to fine-tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2003 anime (outside of &lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt;), the silver pocket watch given to State Alchemists can &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/207/274"&gt;amplify their power&lt;/a&gt;; however, a knowledge of alchemy is required to use it (and of course, to become a State Alchemist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;how do characters learn alchemy&lt;/em&gt;? They learn it through hard work, perseverance, experience (rough or otherwise), and never giving up (and a little bit of luck never hurts). As you might notice, these are all the traits that a typical &lt;em&gt;shounen&lt;/em&gt; hero (such as Ed) possesses.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6371">&lt;p&gt;In the original series, it's explained that everyone is born with a smaller Gate, connected to the Main Gate, which is then used to access the energy supplied from our world required to perform alchemy. As the person gets older, the connection gets weaker, which is why Dante uses a baby when she wants to call the Gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt;, everyone is born with the ability to use alchemy; however, how it was taught to the populace is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Amestris, it's said a man came from the East to teach the people how to use the energy from tectonic shifts and manipulation of matter toward scientifically practical ends. However, the method was flawed and because that man was Father/Dwarf it allowed him the ability to shut down everyone's ability to use alchemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Xing, it's said that a doctor came from the West to teach the people about alkahestry which focused on using the energy in the Earth called the Dragon's Pulse; the Doctor was  Van Hohenheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gate, however is created within those who have preformed Human Transmutation, as Father/Dwarf required a number of Gates in order to achieve his plan to become God and the only people who could do this was those who had at one stage performed Human Transmutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual ability to perform alchemy seems to be something that can be exchanged at least to God as at the end of &lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt;, Ed gives up his ability to perform alchemy to God, in order to bring Al back to life. God gladly accepts this as a fair price, and congratulates Ed for being the first person to figure out what Equivalent Exchange is.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="40787" Title="What is the &quot;Twin Ciel&quot; theory?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Given the highly positive response to my last question: &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/40466/who-stole-my-candy/40764#40764&quot;&gt;Who stole my candy?&lt;/a&gt;, there seems to be a lot of speculation around this &quot;Twin Ciel&quot; theory or the idea of there being 2 Ciels. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So with that in mind, I am posting a follow-up question to that to ask for the full explanation of the theory and what this means for the series. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone shed some light, links, etc?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40823">&lt;p&gt;So the twin Ciel theory has been floating around the fandom for a few years but has recently gained much more evidence in the last few chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theofficialdoublecieltheorist.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;"The Double-Ciel Theory: A Kuroshitsuji Mystery" on Blogspot&lt;/a&gt; is the most in-depth explanation I could find, though it doesn't contain any recent evidence. To sum up the theory, some believe that Ciel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; is not the actual Ciel Phantomhive, but the younger more sickly twin of the real Ciel who was sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the evidenced in that blog post, the most recent chapters show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Agni looking at pictures of Ciel's family and saying "It can't be," then running off to protect Soma. He finds Soma with a gun at his head, and the person fires but misses and shoots Soma's hand. Soma then says "Why?" Now flash forward and "twin" Ciel and Sebastian come home to find the scene before them. Soma sees "twin" Ciel and hits him. Ciel also sees a bit of the picture Agni was looking at and says "it can't be," and then asks Sebastian "you wouldn't lie to me would you?" Which brings up the fact that Sebastian has never called "twin" Ciel, "Ciel"; only "young master".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are by far the most compelling evidence so far the author has pushed towards supporting the twin theory.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41029">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I will be referring to the boys as the following: Lord Ciel (LC), and
 Young Master (YM, our Ciel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me start from the beginning with all of this until when the fire was happening. After discovering his parents' dead body, YM rushes to find help. He finds Tanaka, and Tanaka seems quite shocked. So in the scene where Tanaka is telling YM to escape, the translation from Japanese to English is "Please escape, Ciel sir it's too risky for you." However, in the Japanese, it reads "Please escape young master! Something has happened to lord Ciel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there's that, after YM and LC are taken an auctioned off. Whilst paying for YM and LC, the man says "This is worth more than two people" This could suggest either YM is rare because he's a noble, or both YM and LC are noble so they're worth more than two people together! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we go ahead to the next visual, we had the prison which would be when they were in Germany and YM was cursed and poisoned. If I remember correctly, he imagines a scene where he is in the cage, holding his brother's (LC) hand, speaking in past tense saying "I still had you." Eventually, we see LC being dragged to the altar for sacrifice, as YM calls out "Ciel" proving the boy who was killed is the real Ciel Phantomhive. YM is still in the cage, watching distressed! After witnessing his brother's death, YM knows he has nothing left. This completes the two terms for summoning a demon; a person willing to give up their soul for a wish (YM) and the price to cross the river (LC), thus Sebastian appears. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason this was successful, was because the cultists weren't prepared to sacrifice their own souls; only the souls of children. As Sebastian states, if you cannot sacrifice your soul, you cannot summon a demon. Sebastian takes LC's soul that was given to him so he could appear. This is why Sebastian gave YM the choice of the contract because Sebastian had already been paid. As expected, YM sacrifices his own soul for power. After all the killing of the children (classic &lt;em&gt;Kuroshitsuji&lt;/em&gt; scene), Sebastian asks YM what his name is. YM pauses for a second looking at LC's dead body, with which he replies; Ciel Phantomhive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next one isn't easy to explain, but I'm going to try because it really proves my point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4DOjl.jpg" alt="Ciel&amp;#39;s bruise under the eye"&gt;          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So remember this boy that was addressed as Ciel. Notice the bruise underneath his eye. If you look through the flashbacks, you will notice this is a constant detail for the altar boy, but the boy who made the contract does not have a bruise under his eye and never did have. That is the only reason we know that YM is not Ciel. Once YM tells Sebastian he is Ciel, Sebastian gives a slight laugh while saying "very well", therefore proving he knew YM was lying. Time skip to a bit later, Sebastian calls YM out saying, "You told me not to lie, but you seem to be quite the liar yourself." YM glares at Sebastian saying "Shut up, you have no right to bring that up," so the flashback ends here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LC is killed, used as the price to summon a demon &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With YM also willing to sacrifice his own soul, a demon appears. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YM is offered a choice because the demon was already paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that leaves one issue, why would YM take the name "Ciel Phantomhive"? Well, it's important to note, YM was the youngest twin, not the heir to the Phantomhive name, LC was. YM was also sick as a child whilst LC was outgoing and healthy, but that alone isn't the reason. LC seemed to get more attention than YM, Lizzy even states "Madam Red loved Ciel the most out of all of us" (the online version isn't translated correctly), which is a major blow to anyone's confidence, so the ideas of why YM took the name "Ciel" are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YM was the son who would never really get anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody seems to like him as much as his outgoing healthy brother. Madam Red, Lizzy, Baron Kelvin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So perhaps he takes his brother's name so people will not see him as weak, and respect him more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or the guilt he feels that his brother deserved to live, not him. YM feels it would have been better if LC came back instead of him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are too many reasons to nail one down right now, we don't have enough information, but YM does seem to have survivor's guilt: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pKKYVl.jpg" alt="YM lamenting"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, YM is interrupted before we know who he is speaking of, but it's most likely LC. In chapter 25, in YM's dream, he states he doesn't want the dead (LC) to forgive him. It shows he &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; LC's death is on his hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all I have right now.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;It's not like I thought that anime could be one thing that one group of people could easily decide one day to do, but costs are seriously way bigger that I could have ever imagined, as shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4175/how-much-does-a-typical-anime-episode-or-series-cost-to-make&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for example, what's worse is that making a simple episode can even be more expensive than that, as shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#Industry&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it can even go up to 300,000 $ per episode.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It literally says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;An anime episode can cost between US$100,000 and US$300,000 to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That maximum is around 6 times bigger than what I thought an anime episode could cost at most (considering that what's animated is a top series, with top animators, top animation programs, top voice actors and so on).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All costs shown on first link are around 3 to 10 times bigger that I would have expected, so I'd like a general explanation, prefarably using the costs shown in first link as a base, of why it is so expensive to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39774">&lt;p&gt;As animated television goes, anime is actually made on the cheap. &lt;a href="http://lineboil.com/how-much-does-an-animated-tv-episode-cost/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; goes over the costs per episode of a few different US animated shows; every one of them is more expensive than the cited high-end cost of $300,000 per episode for anime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; seems to be top in costs; according to the article, it cost around $2 million per episode in 2007. &lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-renewed-two-more-seasons-245748" rel="noreferrer"&gt;A 2011 source&lt;/a&gt; indicates that voice acting costs per episode alone were around $300,000, and that was after the actors took a 30% pay cut, coming down from a high of around $440,000 per episode. That means &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; was paying more per episode &lt;strong&gt;for voice acting alone&lt;/strong&gt; than the entire budget of an average anime episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest, Nickelodeon apparently spends around $600k per episode on their animated shows; the sources come from comments made around the release of &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/spongebob-budget-question.5255321/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a post in a forum&lt;/a&gt; cites a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article that I can't read because it's behind a paywall claiming that &lt;em&gt;Spongebob&lt;/em&gt; too is around $600k per episode. I was shocked that &lt;a href="http://www.awn.com/blog/drawing-close-drawn-together-movie-movie" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawn Together&lt;/em&gt; got $700k per episode&lt;/a&gt; since it was widely regarded as terrible and was canceled. &lt;a href="http://cineuropa.org/dd.aspx?t=dossier&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;tid=1437&amp;amp;did=201387" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This Cineeuropa article&lt;/a&gt; claims that the average hour of US animation in 2007 cost &#8364;776k (about $800k today). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-09-08/.92622" rel="noreferrer"&gt;An Answerman column&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 also goes over this and offers some conjectures about why: US animators get paid more, thanks to unions and other market factors, and voice actors, like other television actors on US TV, tend to make more money as the show goes on longer, as we saw with &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-15/study-animators-earned-usd28000-on-average-in-japan-in-2013/.87762" rel="noreferrer"&gt;another 2015 article&lt;/a&gt;, ANN reports on a study finding that animators in Japan make around $28,000 a year, which is a very modest salary in the US. &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-09-10/directors-dispute-reports-of-poor-animator-salaries" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This 2009 article&lt;/a&gt; goes into more details on staff salaries in anime. &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-08-19/.91831" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Another Answerman column&lt;/a&gt; touches on voice actor salaries in Japan and mentions that most voice actors make between $120 and $360 per episode, though the more famous ones can set their price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anime are not really that expensive to make, in terms of the usual cost of producing a professional level half-hour animated television show with top talent. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41198">&lt;p&gt;It's depending on the technology which is used by the studio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can use the forward algorithms of animator programs to easily create the good anime without scanning, but draw on screen can reduce the artistic level of the movie if the artists aren't familiar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice actors can be rented or you can ask your friends for voicing to reduce money until you already have sold a lot of anime.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to highlight few points which might help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oda stated in an &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt; that Devil Fruit users are susceptible to all
  types of water, not just seawater.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This includes the white sea surrounding Skypiea. He elaborated on
  this, saying that "moving" water, like rain or waves, does not weaken
  Devil Fruit users, while standing water does. This was also shown
  first when Monkey D. Luffy was in the Dance-Powder induced rain and
  did not feel his power slipping away, and again when on Zou, the sea
  water that Zunisha used to shower did not affect him despite being sea
  water as it was "moving" water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the main conclusion which is given in wiki that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devil Fruit user will not be restricted in the water if he or she is not physically touching the water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So according to me it might affect as long as devil fruit users are physically touching them.&lt;/p&gt;

And yet, I don't believe that the anime has reached the ending.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Bleach anime stop airing? And did Bleach manga also end its serialization? Though for the case of the manga, I am not sure if it has actually finished.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18812">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_%28anime%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the original run of Bleach anime in Japan has finished since March 2012. It seems that you follow the English dub, which &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_episodes#Season_16:_The_Lost_Agent_.282011.E2.80.932012.29" rel="nofollow"&gt;finished airing on November 1st, 2014&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't realize that it stopped airing in Japan long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the reason, from the posts I have seen on the Internet, there seems to be no official reason given for the cancellation of the anime series. (Usually, the official reason will be cited before people give their own interpretation or speculation of the situation, but I don't see any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://edas88.hubpages.com/hub/Will-Bleach-Return-and-When" rel="nofollow"&gt;This page by edas88&lt;/a&gt; gives 2 theory as for why the series was cancelled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anime was sub-par and had too many fillers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.jp/animesityouritu/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt; for TV anime series viewership rating is reliable or not, but viewership for Bleach started out at around 5%, gradually dropped but still managed to get 2-3% up to the point of Aizen's defeat, but it reduced further and sustained at 1-2% till the point it was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the other two series in the &lt;em&gt;Big 3&lt;/em&gt;, One Piece sustained at around 10% viewership over the same period, and Naruto at 7-9% at the beginning, but still got 3-5% at the point Bleach anime was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_%28anime%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says that 111 of all 366 episodes are fillers.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anime stopped to wait for more material from the manga, instead of continuing with filler episodes as what they had been doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this side, at the time of writing, there are &lt;a href="http://www.idigitaltimes.com/bleach-anime-returns-expect-2015-release-once-manga-finishes-376751" rel="nofollow"&gt;some speculations&lt;/a&gt; that the anime will restart production in 2015, since the manga is expected to end in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing (May 27th, 2015), the manga has not ended its serialization yet. According to &lt;a href="https://www.mangaupdates.com/releases.html?search=35&amp;amp;stype=series" rel="nofollow"&gt;mangaupdates&lt;/a&gt;, chapter 627 was released on May 21st, 2015 by scanlation groups. There is no news headline regarding the imminent end of the serialization (except that it is confirmed to end in 2015), so I think it is going to continue for at least a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

We see it on how: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edo Tensei Deidara had both eyes instead of his robot left eye;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edo Tensei Sasori had a 'human' body instead of a puppet one;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when it comes to Madara, Kabuto had aprimorated the Edo Tensei Jutso so when he brought Madara back to life he was younger and stronger than he was when he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the image after he showed everyone that he has a pair of Rinnegan. Kabuto mentions that he made modifications to the body.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="46647">&lt;p&gt;I agree this definitely a plothole. Madara was having rinnegan in eyes when his very eyes (literally) were located elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of getting back lost due from izanagi applies to both edo tensei eyes and actual ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My speculations to explain this (no proofs available):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edo rinnegan got the eyes (EMS only) when Madara was at physical peak but his soul and memories experienced rinnegan before death and so activated it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Izanagi loss - He stole an normal uchiha eyes and activated all of MS EMS and rinnegan having experienced it in other eye. All this near his death.&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="634" Title="What's written in Ayatsuji Tsukasa's notebook?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about the notebook seen in the episode 21 of Amagami SS. She said it contained something that could make her leave the school (maybe being expelled?). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If it's that serious, could it be a crime? Did I miss an important plot detail that explains it? Do the contents even get explained in another adaptation of Amagami like the manga or the VN, or are they completely unknown?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="636">&lt;p&gt;There is no mention of the exact contents of the notebook in the original VN or the anime. There are a couple of short sequel games which I have not gone through, so in principle there could be some explanation there, but given how important this is I doubt they'd want to relegate it to a side-game. Hence, the authors have definitely and deliberately hidden what is in her notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some good theories. The most common viewpoint is that she was using the notebook as a diary to vent her frustration with everyone else, particularly her sister. Despite the fact that Tsukasa is harder-working, her sister always seems to be more popular. Of course, she has more to vent about than that, and it's pretty safe to guess that the diary contained all sorts of things about everyone. That's why, if it ever went public, she wouldn't be able to go to school any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.animesuki.com/showpost.php?p=3385022&amp;amp;postcount=39" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This forum post&lt;/a&gt; provides a pretty complete and fairly consistent picture of Ayatsuji from a psychological standpoint. The segment about her notebook is quoted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Birth and the Function of her Diary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We believe that [having someone/something to listen to her] was the function of her diary, which she so desperately guarded. Here, the Inner Tsukasa was writing down her life, her frustrations, and her thoughts which she couldn't share with anybody. In a way, it was her way to deal with whatever gave her a hard time. Some kind of offline-blog, talking to herself. It also explains why the contents would be damaging enough that she "couldn't come to school anymore" if they'd ever come out.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We could see in episode 3 how much she was annoyed at the laziness and pettiness of the three bitches. Her Facade would have never allowed to show her anger - instead, it rather demanded that she would go through a humiliating insincere teary apology, sacrificing her (absolutely justified) anger and pride for the sake of ultimate success. In the past, she probably would have made an entry in the diary - this time, she did it in person, with disastrous results.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This is how Junichi uncovered the "Inner" Tsukasa - when he picked up the diary. Tsukasa believed that he had actually read it, and that there was no need to maintain the Facade towards him anymore. It also proves that Ayatsuji has no split or bipolar personality: The Inner Tsukasa is always in control - she was able to drop the Facade in a second.&lt;/p&gt;

By recollecting this memory Johan attempted a suicide which will be led by Tenma's hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My interpretation into why Johan wanted to commit suicide is because of the recollected memory of Franz saying that they are special hence Johan at the moment of recollecting that memory he cried because that's when he realized what he was doing was wrong hence the suicide attempt and the reason why Nina forgave him. Am I correct?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39028">&lt;p&gt;What I think happened in &lt;em&gt;Monster&lt;/em&gt; is, Johan was the nameless monster. Somehow he might have concluded that the story always ends with the nameless monster being the last person alive, so Johan planned the perfect suicide destroying every trace of him. Now that Tenma learned his real name, I guess he thought he was not the nameless monster anymore, so he committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for being psychopath, maybe it happened when he started to question himself if he was the wanted child as the mother gave Nina to Bonaparte. At that particular moment, he was reading that nameless monster story. Then I guess at 511 Kinderheim when he forgot everything, he became a loose nut and his memory of wanting to be the nameless monster (last person alive) came back when he read the book at the library, and then he planned the perfect suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess that's when the real story starts, and I also think that Nina always had a clue of Johan wanting to be the nameless monster.&lt;/p&gt;

The one thing I remember well was the main characters flying into space from earth after weird stuff happened. They discover the earth is shaped oddly. It is flat and looks like a city being held up by giant statues of people. They seemed to recognize the statues. The sandman character mentioned something about creating a pure dream from the mind of an individual girl in the main cast. This sandman seemed to be an antagonist.

This movie kinda stands on its own, but not knowing the characters is kinda sad.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="13536" Title="In Law vs Doflamingo, why didn't Law use ROOM?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt;, Law's ROOM ability is a very strong technique, and he can use it to slice whatever he wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why didn't he use it when fighting against Doflamingo to slice him to pieces?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13537">&lt;p&gt;Law did use his Ope Ope no Mi. In chapter 729, Law has his room up and tries to slash Doflamingo, but unless he can actually get a hit in, the room isn't going to do him much good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NoNGcm.png" alt="the manga panel showing Law using ROOM in the fight with Doflamingo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time (chapter 724) that Law used his ability on Doflamingo, he could have tried to get a sneak attack in, but that would have been insane. If he would have slashed at this point, it would probably have been a suicide. He would potentially hit Sanji since he couldn't move anymore, he could end up falling in the ocean and Doflamingo would still have been able to attack Sanji with his whip because the slash wouldn't have stopped him from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TaPgTm.png" alt="the manga panel showing Law using ROOM the second time"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Law basically didn't have a good opportunity to set up his room and have time to get a clean slash in with his sword. Also, don't forget that Law's slash would only slice the body, but not actually damage it and since Doflamingo uses strings, he could just get his body part back to re-attach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; With the upcoming fight from next week or the week after, he might still end up slicing Doflamingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13539">&lt;p&gt;In the manga, particularly chapter 729, Law doesn't use his sword other than to defend against one of Doflamingo's string attacks. It's a quick skirmish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the anime, they're using what I call "filler padding" where you expand on canon scenes with non-manga content to elaborate the details. An example of this from episode 656 at about 7m30s shows Law using room &amp;amp; slicing where parts of the gate split easily enough but it was countered by Doflamingo's strings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Law vs Mingo, why didn't Law use ROOM?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did in both manga chapter 724 and anime episode 656 on the bridge just briefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why doesn't Law use it (ROOM) when fighting against Doflamingo to slice him to pieces?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, according to a filler padded scene of combat, Doflamingo can defend against it. Also, it reinforces why Vergo thought Law couldn't cut him in Punk Hazard by believing Law to be too weak to slice through his Haki-coated body. The point is, some people can resist Law's slice to keep him from being overpowered.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Since Kurisu is alive, and even though her paper was burned, she would republish it given how seriously her father took it, How come WW3 doesn't happen in the Stein's Gate worldline? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="55758">&lt;p&gt;It can be assumed Kurisu would never touch that theory again. Even if she did, it would never end up being used for evil. Otherwise, it would not be Steins Gate and Suzuha would time-travel from the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what we've seen in the &lt;em&gt;Steins;Gate&lt;/em&gt; visual novel and some drama CDs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Time travel can exist in any world line and it doesn't necessarily end up with a dystopia or a world war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perspective for this is the attractor fields. AFs are groups of world lines that converge to the same future. The world lines in the Alpha AF always converge to the SERN dystopia and the Beta to WW3. The world line Steins Gate lies in both Alpha and Beta, making itself its own AF, converging to neither and having its own unknown future. So time travel or not, WW3 should not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is largely speculation btw.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;What happened to Goku in those 100 years after he left the Earth (by which Pan was already an old woman)? Did Goku die or not?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="19818">&lt;p&gt;A lot can be said about the last episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that Goku went to train with Shenlon, you could argue that he offered his own life for that last wish, you could argue that it was all an illusion, seeing Pan holding his shirt after he had supposedly left, you could argue that he became one with the Dragon Balls/Shenlon, you could argue that he'd become immortal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list goes on and it will remain to your own imagination what you believe has happened to Goku, as it was never thoroughly explained in the anime. I guess if anything, we could agree that Goku had surpassed human existence and entered a state different from being alive or dead as we know them.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28014">&lt;p&gt;Goku was dead to begin with at the end of &lt;em&gt;DB GT&lt;/em&gt;, and when asked if they should revive him back, he didn't let them do that. Instead, he feared that there are more dangerous and strong fighters in the world, and he needed to practice and therefore went with Shenron to practice and live a peaceful life for sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did mention he will come back when the time is right, and since then there were rumours that a new season will come. But at the moment, there isn't any and &lt;em&gt;GT&lt;/em&gt; weren't part of the original &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41046">&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Super&lt;/em&gt; ends after the Tournament of Power, and if Universe 7 wins, Goku would have asked Super Shenron to reconstruct the destroyed universe and erase the memory of all the people of Universe 7 from meeting Beerus for the first time at the end of the tournament. Then they would have lived a normal life. And after this, &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball GT&lt;/em&gt; is started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball GT&lt;/em&gt;, Shenron glows his eyes and due to this, Goku is revived and Shenron asks Goku to come with him. And Goku says yes to Shenron, which was an unexpected behaviour shown by him. After Shenron revived Goku, he must have given his memory back and I think Shenron made him immortal and given him a god soul because of his good deeds. And due to this, in the farewell tour, Goku was able to go to hell to meet Piccolo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the ending of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball GT&lt;/em&gt;, Goku meets Goku junior and disappears. And at last, Goku was seen by Pan in World Martial Arts tournament after 100 years. He was checking if the earth's protection was in good hands. And at last, Goku fly with his power pole "until we meet again".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Goku was not dead, he was trained by other gods and at last made him an immortal saiyan god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiro Mashima's earlier work &lt;em&gt;Rave Master&lt;/em&gt; was quite similar artistically to Eiichiro Oda's work &amp;amp; Fairy Tale as well. So, it's not as if Mashima's has purposefully made Fairy Tale similar in an art style similar to One Piece - It's just his own style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QCe9N.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as mentioned before, there is only so much uniqueness that one can have in a show as long as both of the shows are. The combination of those two facts are probably sufficient to pass the comparisons you've shown as coincidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I would imagine that it's not doing Oda any harm so he's chosen to leave it be if it was the case that there was some level of plagarism going on.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22207">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism"&gt;Plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; is a legal crime and thereby &lt;strong&gt;its definition and how it is handled differs by nation&lt;/strong&gt; (also, plagiarism and copyright infringement are two different things). For example, in the U.S., an illustration that draws upon previous works by others must be different enough that a specific source for it cannot be pinpointed and that multiple possible sources cannot be presented (to mash-up a couple of works and/or to change the pose slightly can be enough that it does not constitute copyright infringement). Some of the illustrations you include above are not clearly similar enough to count under that sort of definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;Japan is not a country that is as concerned about plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt; as many other nations. Plagiarism is generally thought of as poor behavior &lt;strong&gt;in the academic context&lt;/strong&gt; and when infamous cases of it come out in the international sphere, &lt;strong&gt;an apology&lt;/strong&gt; and possibly &lt;strong&gt;a retraction&lt;/strong&gt; of the academic paper may be made: &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579438131341933464"&gt;a recent example&lt;/a&gt; is the stem-cell research dissertation that contained almost identical portions to text posted on a U.S. National Institutes of Health website; the author "said she was 'very hurt' by the media hoopla surrounding the research" and the university "released a statement of apology it said was signed by Dr. Obokata and two of her co-authors. They said they 'humbly accept the various suggestions made about the flaws in our paper' and were discussing a retraction . . ."
Some universities do not even prepare and distribute a plagiarism policy, professors vocally welcome plagiarism (I heard the other day a prof say in a room of fellow instructors and students that it is fine for students to plagiarize speeches as a way of practicing English), and unwelcome plagiarism noticed by professors is often not reported (instead, the work is graded according to its quality or the student fails the course. If the plagiarism is reported, the prof must fill out lots of paperwork and the student fails the course anyway, which means the same student may be back in the same class next semester and the same prof has to deal with him/her again, so failing the student quietly or grading the work on its own merit [usually not high quality] can be preferred. This is especially true because once the paperwork is filed, the school administration can decide whether or not to give the student any consequences or can tell the prof to please go ahead and pass the student).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In standard publishing&lt;/strong&gt;, plagiarism is usually dealt with by simply making a &lt;strong&gt;public apology, or an expression of regret&lt;/strong&gt; (which carefully avoids technically apologizing), and possibly &lt;strong&gt;withdrawing further sales of the publication&lt;/strong&gt; and/or the plagiarist &lt;strong&gt;promptly retires&lt;/strong&gt; (a culturally well-thought-of means of demonstrating that you were not qualified to have that role; if a Japanese company makes a major blunder, often the boss will announce retirement to take the blame): see the examples in the &lt;a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9B%97%E4%BD%9C#.E7.9B.97.E4.BD.9C.E3.81.AE.E4.BE.8B"&gt;Japanese Wikipedia page on plagiarism&lt;/a&gt;. In only two of the cases listed there did the victim press charges and file a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese are often assuaged by, or really &lt;strong&gt;the only thing they wanted out of their complaint is, an apology&lt;/strong&gt;. In Japanese culture, it is rude to explain in an apology why the thing happened (i.e. if you are late to class, only say you're sorry for being late; do not mention whether your mother just got rushed to the hospital or the train got delayed from a suicide on the tracks or you overslept. They want the apology only, and it is more polite to make it as succinct as possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sue over plagiarism, the victim who was wronged (the publishing company that owns the plagiarized work, or possibly the author of the plagiarized work) must have a desire to sue; then it will come up before a prosecutor and then possibly proceed to court (sometimes the prosecutor determines that the defendant is not guilty, or for some other reason that it would not be best for the case to go to trial, and it dies in the prosecutor's office. Fictional examples of this can be seen in the Japanese live-action TV drama &lt;em&gt;HERO&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;In Japanese culture, suing is not as common and viewed as respectable behavior&lt;/strong&gt; as it is in some other countries. About a year ago at my Japanese university, a student was physically abusing another student and it was found out by an American international student, who reported it to the advisor. The advisor was angry that this was reported by the international student because it could look bad for the department, and the police came to campus to investigate but were not able to do anything because the victim refused to admit the abuse, since if he did so, his chance of getting hired by a Japanese company after graduation would sharply decrease: &lt;strong&gt;a person who reports misdemeanors is considered a trouble-maker&lt;/strong&gt; that a company would not want to hire; the batterer went off scot-free. This is not the unfortunate case of every crime in Japan, but it is prevalent for victims to want to protect their standing in society by not getting involved in a police report or lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some character designs, and battle poses, are common enough&lt;/strong&gt; in many manga/anime titles that no one could sue over them (such as hair styles like the long, black straight hair that waves at the bottom seen in Tomoyo in &lt;em&gt;Cardcaptor Sakura&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tsubasa Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, or the high ponytail with a wide ribon or sash seen in Kaoru in &lt;em&gt;Rurouni Kenshin&lt;/em&gt;, or the shooting-straight-up spikes of hair like Gon in &lt;em&gt;HUNTER x HUNTER&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also not considered plagiarism to &lt;strong&gt;pay tribute&lt;/strong&gt; to a character/costume design that you like in a parody sort of way. Having your characters cosplay is the easiest way, like &lt;em&gt;Hyouka&lt;/em&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://hyouka.wikia.com/wiki/Mayaka_Ibara"&gt;Ibara Mayaka&lt;/a&gt;'s copy of Frolbericheri Frol's fashion in the classic shoujo sci-fi &lt;a href="http://frolbericheri.tripod.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;11 Nin Iru!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (They Were Eleven), but adapting a design in a way that incorporates originality while giving a big hint to the audience who you're giving a shout-out to is also unlikely to garner ill feelings from the artist who created the original character. As an example, &lt;a href="http://wikimoon.org/index.php?title=Sailor_Moon_and_Crayon_Shin-chan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/em&gt; parodies appeared in &lt;em&gt;Crayon Shin-chan&lt;/em&gt; and vice versa&lt;/a&gt;, even though the manga titles were not owned by the same publishing company nor the anime owned by the same animation studio (though both aired on the same TV channel), and &lt;a href="http://wikimoon.org/index.php?title=Cameos"&gt;here's a list&lt;/a&gt; of other series in which Sailor Moon was given a cameo appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2xgXU.gif" alt="Shinnousuke character in Sailor Moon"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, 1) &lt;strong&gt;plagiarism is not considered a major scandal requiring action to be taken&lt;/strong&gt; and 2) &lt;strong&gt;a publishing company or the artist must have a desire to sue for plagiarism, which is not all that common&lt;/strong&gt; in Japan. When Kamiya Yuu's illustrations were &lt;a href="http://seventhstyle.com/2014/09/23/no-game-no-life-artist-caught-tracing/"&gt;accused of plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; on the Twitter account rotiflride (which has since been suspended), no action was taken. When an element in the anime adaption of his &lt;em&gt;No Game No Life&lt;/em&gt; series was discovered to be plagiarized according to another Twitter account, the production committee admitted this and issued an apology, and decided to replace the image for the DVD and Blue-Ray release. The specific artist who committed the plagiarism &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-05-29/no-game-no-life-anime-staff-apologizes-for-using-art-without-authorization/.74993"&gt;wrote a response&lt;/a&gt; which looks vaguely like an apology but which does not technically apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer is quite scientific. A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Reuleaux triangle&lt;/a&gt; can be rotated to create a square shape. This &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5AzbDJ7KYI" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5829336/the-triangle-that-makes-rectangular-holes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; explain it in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenshinhan's hand shape is similar to the Reuleaux triangle. Due to its shape, while it rotates, its cutting edge cut the hole in a shape of square which is shown in the gif below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GfPtk.gif" alt="Animation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13308">&lt;p&gt;The attack leaves a square hole due to the way he holds his hands. When he fires the attack normally he places his hand in a diamond shape and zooms into his target. the attack then is shot and forms the square shape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mZI37.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yPOPL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as you can see that his hands put together form more of a diamond shape and when he fires the attack it rotates and makes the square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;later in the series He changes the way his hands are placed and over laps the thumbs and make a triangle shape with is hands instead of the diamond shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is stated on &lt;a href="http://ultradragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Tri-Beam" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ultra DragonBall wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We don't get to see exactly when the dreams and reality are merging, at the end of the movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Dreams and reality are one and the same because the DC minis have broken down the barrier (and is missing user control interfaces) between the worlds. Therefore everything that exists in the dreamsphere co-exists in the real world, and vice-versa. This is proven by the fact that the buildings all take permanent damage by the dream-creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="507" Title="Which Melty Blood games are relevant, plotwise?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Shingetsutan Tsukihime is a pretty expansive work - a main visual novel, the Kagetsu Tohya supplement, and the Melty Blood games. The last bit, Melty Blood, is especially jarring to a Type-Moon fan who is late to the party - there are many versions, and the format itself is very different from what is normal for Nasu works: a fighting game.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What are the different versions, and how do they differ? What should be played and what skipped, and in what order, if one is playing for the story aspect?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="520">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melty Blood&lt;/strong&gt; is the original game. The story supposedly follows &lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Satsuki_Yumizuka" rel="nofollow"&gt;Satsuki's&lt;/a&gt; route, which was never released with any of TM's games, which takes place one year after &lt;em&gt;Tsukihime&lt;/em&gt;. The story and plot doesn't change with the subsequent expansion, but a lot of side stories are added (more Neco Arcs!). In the original Melty Blood, only six of 14 characters were available to be played, the other 8 had to be unlocked through playing Story Mode. This was later changed in an update for the game (aka the "Nero" patch), which unlocked all the characters from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sion_Eltnam_Atlasia" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sion&lt;/a&gt; is the main character of Melty Blood. She originally came to Shiki's town in order to find the cure for vampireism and defeat the &lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Night_of_Wallachia" rel="nofollow"&gt;Night of Walachia&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In Actress Again, she is responsible for the reenactment of Walachia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is supposedly Satsuki's route...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; She never appears. She is only mentioned a total of three times in the full story, until ReACT. However, if you read into the game's story, her appearance could might as well been a fake created by Wallachia or White Len... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melty Blood ReACT&lt;/strong&gt; is an expansion for the original game (like Burning Crusade was to World of Warcraft). This expansion added 2 playable characters and 4 non-playable ones. I believe ReACT also adds an Arcade mode, which is a continuation of sorts of what happens in the Story Mode played out in fighting game style instead of visual novel style. Start with this game if you are just starting out with Melty Blood series and want the whole story (original Story Mode + Arcade Mode).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melty Blood Act Cadenza&lt;/strong&gt; is a further expansion of ReACT. This added 4 additional playable characters and various graphical and gameplay changes. Note that this version does NOT have a Story Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melty Blood Actress Again&lt;/strong&gt; is a sequel to the previous game. It features many drasticly new mechanics, two new characters, and 3 different fighting styles for all known characters. Several secondary characters have had their storylines expanded upon to include what happened to them after the main storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;After Rin was killed, he went rogue and attacked Konoha with the Nine-Tails, and he was obsessed only with his Tsuki no Me plan. Didn't he have any sibling, parent, or someone to care about?? I don't remember seeing anyone close to Obito besides his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7376">&lt;p&gt;The Naruto Wikia &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Obito_Uchiha" rel="nofollow"&gt;article on Obito Uchiha&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obito grew up not knowing who his parents were, leaving him alone and forced to fend for himself. This sad upbringing led Obito to dream of one day becoming the Hokage so that the people of the village would acknowledge his existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think no, he didn't have any parents, siblings or friends, until he met Rin and Kakashi. That is why he was obsessed with the Eye of the Moon plan. On second thought, I think Obito was rejected even by the other Uchiha, so he was totally alone.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7404">&lt;p&gt;Expanding on Rinneg4n's answer. 
There was a picture of Obito's parents. The photo is aged and has tears, while also being fastened to the wall, instead of tacked. It's probably leading to the assumption that it is very old, and that his parents had died when he was a young age, perhaps during the Second or Third Great Shinobi Wars. Uchiha are a clan built on feelings, and Obito's feeling of loneliness are what fueled his goals with his teammates and his hope of being Hokage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this by theory, and other people have made assumptions such as them being Rin's parents, alluding to Obito being a stalker, or that Kagami Uchiha (Shisui's dad) is really Obito's dad, since the age difference is not all too impossible, considering Hiruzen had Asuma, and Asuma was Obito's classmate, while Hiruzen was in the same class as Kagami. This leads to fan-theories of Obito being Shisui's brother. Of course nothing is set in fact, as Kishi hasn't released any further information pertaining to Obito's parents.&lt;/p&gt;

One thing remains same is that Saiyans never look aged.&#10;The last episode of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball GT&lt;/em&gt; shows &lt;strong&gt;Pan&lt;/strong&gt; as a grandma, but &lt;strong&gt;Goku&lt;/strong&gt; was looking as young as he was in &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Z&lt;/em&gt;. Why don't Saiyans age?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20308">&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, they do age, just very slowly in adulthood. This is a genetic trait, I assume, to reach longer duration of physical demands. They are designed to be fighters, and longevity of a lifespan is only practical. Vegeta confirmed this towards the end of DBZ: "So they can fight longer". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a quick Google search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the Daizenshuu, Saiyan's lifespan is about the same as an average Human (70 to 90 years, with exceptions, of course), but keep in their peak longer. Unlike Humans, Saiyans remain in their youth and prime much longer. As explained by Vegeta near the end of Dragon Ball Z, they stay young longer because they live for and are built for battle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;From &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Saiyan" rel="nofollow"&gt;Saiyan&lt;/a&gt; article on Dragon Ball wiki. (Visit the link for more examples, and a more definitive explanation).&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else to consider: they stay in their prime longer because they are full Saiyans, whereas Pan is only quarter Saiyan.&lt;/p&gt;

Isn't it noteworthy? I don't see any sources highlighting this ability of his (even in Wiki)!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26580">&lt;p&gt;I think it's a case of Zoro always being cautious and alert much like a Samurai as opposed to him subconsciously using haki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see evidence of this in Whiskey Peak where Zoro doesn't put his guard down against the villagers and ensures limits his drinking when the crew were partying which pays off when we find out they were bounty hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26648">&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Haki/Kenbunshoku_Haki" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;One Piece wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kenbunshoku Haki, also known as Mantra on Skypiea, is a form of Haki that allows the user to sense the presence of others, even if they are concealed from view or too far to see naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f83e8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f83e8.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the aura which is seen through Kenbunshoku Haki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The user can also use this Haki to predict an opponent's moves shortly before they make them, thereby making the attack much easier to evade with enough skill. This prediction appears to the user as an image or brief "premonition" of what the opponent will do in the user's mind's eye, and the damage the user will take if the attack actually "hits". It appears that the more killing intent the enemy has, the easier they are to predict. Although, more skilled users can predict future moves whether there are ambient murderous intents or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, Zoro detecting the change in climate can't be  a consequence of his Kenbunshoku Haki, because it's inanimate and has nothing to do with a living thing. It's not possible to detect the "aura" of climate either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though the power allows the user to predict most attacks, it can be circumvented by various means. It cannot predict inherently random attacks; for example, Luffy managed to bypass Enel's Mantra by bouncing his fists off a nearby wall, to prevent himself and thus Enel from knowing where they would land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Zoro sensing the halt of the ship in the Calm Belt, it's highly unlikely that it was his Kenbunshoku Haki as well because the Straw Hats had merely begun their journey then, and noone was aware of their Haki, or even unconsciously used it. Not to mention, the halting of their ship was not intentional (a result of the action of another living thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's more of Zoro keeping an eye out for changes in the surroundings than it being his Haki. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26660">&lt;p&gt;I do agree with Ashish Gupta's answer. Also would like to add some more points to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently Zoro is given a duty of Monitoring the surroundings, generally sits(or sleeps) on top of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;
This Duty, however was never announced. And shown to be shared by other strawhat members too. So not sure if he chose it himself or his team members acknowledged his ability. But the SHP team does depend on his observation skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ashish noted, it's definitely not an "Observation Haki" but could merely be a presence of mind and cautiousness, perhaps a sign of a true swordsman..&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="31463" Title="How different are the manga, anime and movie versions of Ajin?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Ajin is originally &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/manga/49865/Ajin&quot;&gt;a manga&lt;/a&gt;, that has subsequently had a few adaptations into anime. In November 2015, it seems to have been adapted into a movie: &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/anime/30868/Ajin_Part_1__Shoudou&quot;&gt;Ajin Part 1: Shoudou (Ajin: Demi-Human - Compel)&lt;/a&gt;. MAL's blurb for the movie reads:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;For high schooler Kei&#8212;and for at least forty-six others&#8212;immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Sadly for Kei, such a feat doesn't make him a superhero. In the eyes of both the general public and governments, he's a rare specimen who needs to be hunted down and handed over to scientists to be experimented on for life&#8212;a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The movie lists two yet unreleased sequels: &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/anime/30869/Ajin_Part_2__Shoutotsu&quot;&gt;Ajin Part 2: Shoutotsu&lt;/a&gt;, set to be released in May 2016; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/anime/30870/Ajin_Part_3__Shougeki&quot;&gt;Ajin Part 3: Shougeki&lt;/a&gt;, set to be released in Seprember 2016. The blurb for these two is the same as the one for the first movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The manga was also adapted into an anime series, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/anime/31580/Ajin&quot;&gt;Ajin&lt;/a&gt;, released between January and April 2016 (the Winter 2016 season). This one lists the three movies as &quot;Alternative versions&quot;, and its blurb reads:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Where there is life, there is death... or is there? What would you do if you could never die? The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Seventeen years ago, the existence of a special species called Ajin was discovered in Africa. They are said to be immortal beings, with several supernatural abilities, that look just like any other human being. Are these Ajin just random phenomena of nature or were they purposely sent to Earth to destroy it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Since their first discovery, several other Ajin appearances have been reported worldwide. For the majority of citizens though, these creatures are less reality and more of something you see every once in a while in a textbook or on the news. This is how it was for the young protagonist of the series, Kei. That was until a sudden turn of events changed his life forever...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Ajin is a supernatural anime full of complex ideas about life and death, as well as the dark side of human nature. What does it mean to truly be human?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely clear to me whether the first movie covers the anime series and the other two are new content, or whether the three movies are supposed to be recaps of the whole series (maybe there are supposed to be three anime seasons of Ajin, and each of the movies recaps one of them?).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's the relation between the manga, the anime series, and the movies (given that two of the three movies haven't been released yet, that part may be harder to answer)? Are the adaptations faithful to the manga?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="37620">&lt;p&gt;I have watched the anime until the very last episode so far, which is the 8th of the second season, while I also keep on reading the manga (it is still on going). First season of Ajin is totally faithful to the manga until the last two episodes, then it just changes a little so it is not a big deal. But this second season is, from the 2 episode and on, super different from the manga. Now, this does not mean anime is not as good as the manga, this second season is very nice indeed, but what happens is that in the manga there were some really interesting parts involving important character backstory. For example, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Izumi's which was very crude and harrowing but it seems like in the anime they have censored it, which really pissed me off. Then we got Kei Nagai's true feelings towards what is going on around him, which is not clearly shown in anime, and also and the most different thing: they have changed all the main plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that happens in the manga that should have been in this second season is not there, the fights, the crazy af plans of Satou, etc. This, however, could be explained because I believe the second season started when this amazing arc in the manga was not over yet, so I guess production decided to just walk the FMA path. But as I said, it is still worth watching it, it is good and adds new stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; we can see some development in Izumi and Tosaki's relationship and we kinda get 1 minute or less of fanservice with cute Nagai blushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah basically, first season is completely faithful, second season is not but it still very good.  &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;During his fight against Minato, it seemed that Tobi was trying to send Minato to Kamui's dimension. Even if Tobi had succeeded, couldn't Minato just teleport to one of his special kunai using the Flying Thunder God technique? Tobi knew of the Flying Thunder God technique, so what did he want to accomplish by sending Minato to Kamui's dimension?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13936">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kamui" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; page about Kamui's abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite not always being present, Obito could keep targets under genjutsu while they were confined inside this technique's pocket dimension, thus keeping them incapacitated for extended durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobi knew that he cannot defeat the Fourth Hokage so easily while keeping Kyuubi under his control, since controlling Kyuubi itself consumes a lot of chakra. Hence, he may have tried sending Minato to Kamui's dimension to keep him out of the equation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minato can teleport to his Flying Thunder God formulas (specially marked kunai), but it isn't revealed whether he can do it from a different dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="30017">&lt;p&gt;Just to add to the already given answer. From the wiki page of Space Time Ninjutsu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It appears that each specific space-time technique has its own unique
  dimensional void that other techniques cannot normally access.[5]
  However, a user can synchronise their respective dimension with the
  other one to gain access to it. To achieve this feat, however,
  requires an enormous amount of chakra.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

This to me seems like Lisa is saying that she won't lose to Maya or Jun in claiming Tatsuya.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I have always got the impression Jun is effeminate or something of the like but I never got an impression that he was homosexual. I am wondering then if Jun is homosexual. If not, what is Lisa talking about?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="30358">&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't know how much you were paying attention to the game if you didn't figure out Jun is homosexual... He has loved Tatsuya since he was a child; this game is one of few that do not shy away from exposing his orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the demon contact description he has with Lisa, it says they are rivals in love (over Tatsuya). In his demon contact descriptions with Maya and Tatsuya as well as Lisa and Tatsuya, both are referred to as "love triangles" because he is after Tatsuya as well. He even flirts with Tatsuya, very obviously, and both Eikichi and Lisa acknowledge this. In fact it wouldn't be at all outrageous to suggest Tatsuya returns his affections, given his behaviour in-game and the word of the creators. In any case, Jun is homosexual and Tatsuya is bisexual, they are both explicitly attracted to men.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="3866" Title="Are there any non-Japanese manga/anime authors or studios?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Manga and anime famously originate from Japan, and the vast majority of the big names in manga and anime are Japanese; Hayao Miyazaki, Hideaki Anno, Hiromu Arakawa, and Masashi Kishimoto come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Japan, I can really only think of one creator who had their work become an anime/manga: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltora_Quest_%28series%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deltora Quest&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; was adapted into an anime and manga and was created by an Australian writer, Emily Rodda.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Rodda, however, are there any* international creators, particularly from the Western world, that have successfully published manga (or anime) in Japan, &lt;em&gt;manhua&lt;/em&gt; in China, or &lt;em&gt;manhwa&lt;/em&gt; in Korea? Have any Western studios created and produced** anime (or rather, anime-influenced) series?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* - An exhaustive list is not necessary; a few examples from various countries and maybe some stats versus Japan, if possible.&lt;br&gt;&#10;** - Not as a result of outsourcing.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3867">&lt;p&gt;Don't know of a non-Japanese studio that produces &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; anime, but the series &lt;strong&gt;Oban Star Racers&lt;/strong&gt; was produced by a French studio, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sav!_The_World_Productions"&gt;Sav! The World Productions&lt;/a&gt;" along-side Bandai and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Studio 4C production "&lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10231"&gt;First Squad&lt;/a&gt;" has writing credits to Russian studio &lt;strong&gt;Molot Entertainment Film&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as mangaka, there's a lot of Korean manwha artists/writers that get published in Japanese serials. I don't think that necessarily makes them "mangaka". The series "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_of_the_Phantom_Master"&gt;Blade of the Phantom Master&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;strong&gt;Youn In-wan&lt;/strong&gt; was serialized in "Monthly Sunday Gene-X" in Japan (published by Shogakukan). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=5047"&gt;Shin Yong-Gwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also had his first couple of works published in "Young Champ". &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I have heard rumors he only becomes a death scythe in the manga but it is still unclear. Has it just not happened yet in the anime?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26635">&lt;p&gt;No, in the anime of soul eater a death scythe is more of a conceptual goal than a visible state of progression, however, as the anime progresses a character who is an actual death scythe is introduced and it's power is displayed to reinforce that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the anime also ends at the internal investigation arc (chapters 38-40) as the Kishin arc - Arachnophobia vs DWMA - is anime only. I will leave out details if you haven't seen it to avoid spoilers but I do recommend watching it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My source is that I watched the anime fairly recently and recall the details. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26636">&lt;p&gt;In the anime no, however know that the anime &lt;strong&gt;does not follow the manga entirely&lt;/strong&gt;, as Hikari &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/26635/1587"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the anime also ends at the internal investigation arc (chapters 38-40) as the Kishin arc - Arachnophobia vs DWMA - is anime only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is when the anime deviates from the manga as in the manga near the end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Crona ends up becoming a Kishin and flees to the Moon with an army of clowns similar to the 2 clowns that Kid faced in the anime when he went to obtain the last of Ebion's Tools needed for Death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i havn't read the manga so i don't know exactly when but on Soul's Synopsis &lt;a href="http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_Evans/Synopsis#Formation" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikia Page&lt;/a&gt; under Formation, partway though the second paragraph it says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Spirit hands Soul Arachne's Witch soul and congratulates him on becoming a Death Weapon. The other members of Spartoi join them, as Soul, drooling and with a smirk on his face, consumes Arachne's soul and becomes a Death Weapon, signaling the birth of the elite student group, Spartoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26651">&lt;p&gt;Well, the anime very greatly deviates from the manga. In fact, only less than the first half of the anime follows the manga. The rest is completely different. Considering the events of the manga: (SPOILERS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Soul becomes death scythe after some time after the events of the Baba Yaga castle by killing a witch. Comparing it with the anime, they had to confront the Kishin right after attacking the Baba Yaga castle and the anime ended eventually. So I don't think Soul ever became a death scythe in the anime. He does become a death scythe in the manga in chapter 62.&lt;/p&gt;

Keeping humans underground, and under constant attacks from beastmen, had the effect of capping that number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corpse Party: Coupling x Anthology&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This manga is a collection of random stories that does not follow any specific timeline. Suggested reading after Blood Covered since it is based off of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corpse Party: Book of Shadows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is the sequel to the Blood Covered manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corpse Party: Sachiko's Game of Love? Hysteric Birthday 2U&lt;/p&gt;

He's still an Uchiha, and still has the Rinnegan and also uses Limbo while in Six Paths mode, however there is no reason for him to. The Truth Seeking Balls are a more perfect defense than Susano'o and the new abilities granted to him by the Six Paths' chakra seemed to be at least as powerful, if not moreso, than his Susano'o. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="47111" Title="Which years/chapters of the manga is based the Gintama anime series?" Body="&lt;p&gt;AFAIK, the Gintama manga series is been done for 15 years, when there is only 4 years of anime (though many of those manga volumes were made after the anime series, so it's impossible the anime is based on them). Which years/chapters of the manga is based the Gintama anime series?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47114">&lt;p&gt;My apologies, after being sought out I believe I didn't answer or read your question to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You asked if any of the managa for Gintama was based on the anime. As I had to re-read your question, the answer to your question is &lt;strong&gt;none of it as far as I have read&lt;/strong&gt;. You said the anime has been done for 15 years is false, the anime(assume your taking about the first to third season of said anime) started in 2006 then ended in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manga that show is based on only came out about two years prior in it's initial Japanese release. The manga to anime followed this trend for awhile, with some arcs being dropped or switched out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More episodes of the anime have came out in recent years with Gintama. Shirogane no Tamashii-hen having aired in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So re-state what i am trying to say in less words.
1. the anime has not been done for 15 years, it has continued with the latest airing of a new anime being in January.
2. the anime and manga have taken a break or two over the years due to various factors (artist health being one of them.)
3. None of the manga has been based on the anime, considering the manga chapter the anime is based on dropped two years prior to the anime episode being released.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47712">&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(Note that there was originally a typo in the first sentence of the question, where the asker had said "anime" when they meant "manga".)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gintama manga has indeed been ongoing for about 15 years (as of 2018) since it first started publishing in &lt;em&gt;Shounen Jump&lt;/em&gt; on December 8, 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gintama MyAnimeList&lt;/a&gt; page does show that it only aired for 4 years, from April 4, 2006 to March 25, 2010. &lt;strong&gt;However, more Gintama episodes aired afterwards.&lt;/strong&gt; The anime's animation studio has put the anime on hiatus several times over the years to give the manga time to get ahead. Whenever the anime resumes, it gets catalogued as a new series on MAL. (Look in the Sequel links under the Related Anime section.) Relevant excerpt from the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gintama/comments/6j6g66/gintama_animemanga_faqs_and_gintama_discord_server/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;r/Gintama FAQ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are there so many series (and why do they take up most of the top 10 in MyAnimeList)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The reason why there are so many series is because the Sunrise Studio decided to take breaks with the anime. The breaks last from a few months to a few years. They did this to allow the manga to catch up so they didn&#8217;t have to make a lot of filler or ruin the pacing. This is why Gintama is split up on MyAnimeList. Each series has its own separate name, but it is all connected. Think of it like the difference between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. Except without time-skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Though it should be noted that the first arc to air after the first anime hiatus was the &lt;a href="https://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Timeskip_Arc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Timeskip Arc&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gintama_episodes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia list of Gintama episodes&lt;/a&gt; that after each hiatus, the series was given a slightly different title to distinguish the new episodes from previous productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify: &lt;strong&gt;The anime episodes are adapted from the manga chapters. The manga is the source material.&lt;/strong&gt; That said, your question about which manga chapters the first anime series is based off of is a bit complicated to answer, because the anime doesn't adapt the manga chapters in the exact same order, so there is a lot of jumping around. However, chapters and episodes more or less move in the same direction in the long run, so to get a good rough idea of the chapter range, you can look at the latest chapter adapted by the latest episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/47111/which-years-chapters-of-the-manga-is-based-the-gintama-anime-series#comment61323_47114"&gt;Gorp pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, Yorozuya Soul does have a nice &lt;a href="http://www.yorozuyasoul.com/anime/mapping" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;mapping from episodes to chapters&lt;/a&gt;, although it's very out of date. (Note that in Gintama, chapters are referred to as "Lessons".) You can see from the Yorozuya Soul table that the latest manga chapter adapted by the first anime series (i.e. first 201 episodes) is chapter 292 (from volume 34).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, Gintama volume 33, which contains chapters 283-291, was published on April 2, 2010.  (See the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gin_Tama_chapters" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;volume list&lt;/a&gt;.) Compare this to when episode 201 first aired, which was on March 25, 2010. So at this point, the anime had more or less caught up to the manga. So you can see why the studio would have wanted to take a hiatus at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some helpful resources with episode-chapter mappings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode pages on the Gintama wikia (for example, &lt;a href="https://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;episode 3&lt;/a&gt;) generally indicate the corresponding chapter or chapters in the infobox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gintama wikia also has a series of pages that list the mappings from arc episodes to chapters: &lt;a href="https://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Gintama_Episode_List/Year_2006" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://gintama.wikia.com/wiki/Gintama_Episode_List/Year_2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Japanese Wikipedia also has a nice table that lists the anime episodes and the corresponding manga chapters: &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%8A%80%E9%AD%82_(%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1)#%E5%90%84%E8%A9%B1%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/&#37504;&#39746;_(&#12450;&#12491;&#12513;)#&#21508;&#35441;&#12522;&#12473;&#12488;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

In it, it says&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;It's time to switch gears and meet a new heroine in our tale and of the upcoming game Tales of Berseria. Velvet Crowe has been imprisoned on a remote island for three years but the time for her breakout has come. With revenge on her mind and demonic powers at her call, will she get what she wants or will her own vengeance create a dangerous bout of malevolence?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I picked up on was the mention of another &lt;em&gt;Tales of&lt;/em&gt; game. Generally from my understanding, most &lt;em&gt;Tales of&lt;/em&gt; games are set in/on separate worlds and unless they share the same main title (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Tales of Symphonia&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Tales of Xilla 1/2&lt;/em&gt;) are generally independent of one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, as the quote mentions, Velvet Crowe is from &lt;em&gt;Tales of Berseria&lt;/em&gt;. Below is a screenshot from the &lt;em&gt;Tales of Zestiria The X&lt;/em&gt; that was in the Funimation email.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5FUom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5FUom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tales of Zestiria The X&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And below are the cover shot and screenshot from &lt;em&gt;Tales of Berseria&lt;/em&gt; showing Velvet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdikxm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qdikxm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tales of Berseria - Cover&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7VBpm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7VBpm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tales of Berseria - Screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While she appears to be wearing something different between &lt;em&gt;Tales of Zestiria The X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tales of Berseria&lt;/em&gt;, her face, hair, and arm still look the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering, is there a connection between &lt;em&gt;Tales of Zestiria&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tales of Berseria&lt;/em&gt;? Is the &lt;em&gt;Tales of Zestiria The X&lt;/em&gt; anime serving as a bridge between the two?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35750">&lt;p&gt;Tales of Berseria took places thousand of years before Zestiria during the time where human could still see Seraph (which during the time are called Malaks who descended from the heaven in droves after some sort of ritual during the Scarlet night).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime most likely try to connect the two by showing the origins of Hellions (Daemons as they called it during Berseria) and how Malaks develop emotion to become Seraphs of the Zestiria timeline. and as the episode 5 title suggest the Beginning of the Calamity.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the second OVA series (Patlabor: New Files), in the episode titled &quot;Snow Rondo&quot; (episode 14). At the end, Asuma Shinohara says it's not a dream and there are hints that it wasn't a dream, but also bits to indicate that didn't happen either.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain what exactly happened? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/K99ny.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Was it a dream?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4154">&lt;p&gt;The OVA stated that the two timelines are real, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past Sinohara walked the girl (Yukie Kashima) in the snow, he liked her but he didn't say anything, maybe because he didn't have the courage to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first timeline is when Sinohara met her at the class reunion.
They had a good time together and they both liked each other.
When finally Sinohara tried to say something  she stopped him and said good bye.
In this timeline we all know that she is some kind of spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second timeline is when Sinohara wakes up again, and he hasn't gone to the class reunion.  Although he didn't see her again, he got the clue that his experience was real. The proof is the postcard he got in the second coat. And he knew what Noa get for him before she even told him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a love story, the spirit just wanted to say goodbye for the last time before she went to a place far away, and this is the most romantic and fun way she could ever done that without making him scared or sad.&lt;/p&gt;

I've not yet read the manga but from what I understand, Nue possesses people by enhancing their negative emotions and leeching of their Chakra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/J%C5%8Dgan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jogan&lt;/a&gt; user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;can perceive the flow of chakra, enabling Boruto to see the visible changes in one's chakra, and likewise, track a target through their chakra. The Jogan can clearly see the chakra pathway system and determine its weakest point. It can also see through invisible barriers that connect between dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards, to seeing or sensing those 'Chakra Shadows,' I think a user with a &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sharingan&lt;/a&gt; can, &lt;em&gt;to some extent, see the Chakra&lt;/em&gt;, because Sharingan users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;can see chakra, giving it colour in order to distinguish it by its composition and source. It can see chakra through some (but not all) obstructions and detect irregularities in a person's chakra flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, if you ask me, &lt;em&gt;Boruto's Jogan seems to be more similar to Byakugan than to Sharingan&lt;/em&gt;, especially with regards to its ability to also see the chakra's pathway system and key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I am a fan of the Anime and its &lt;a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Card-game gameplay&lt;/a&gt;. I even attended Conventions here in our country where dual matches were held and participated by trading card enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27629">&lt;p&gt;I would say this is a fairly opinion-based question, since some people will say the anime is superior to the manga, while many others will say vice versa. I would say the manga is a better place to start; it is its most faithful form, without fillers and without card games shoehorned into every available opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that unlike the anime, the manga takes a while before focusing on card games. Also, in terms of the anime, there are two separate ones, the first made by Toei and the second made by Studio Gallop, though the second continues where the first lefts off. These follow the plot of the manga (although the Toei one is fairly loose about it.) though with noticeable differences (e.g. fillers). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the movies, the first one, simply titled "Yu-Gi-Oh!" Is based on the Toei adaptation. The Pyramid of Light movie is only possibly canon to the Gallop anime, and even then ambiguously so. It takes place shortly after the Battle City arc. "Bonds between time" is sort of commemorative, and it crosses over with GX and 5Ds; I do not recommend watching it before watching GX and 5Ds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the manga, there is also a short series called "Yu-Gi-Oh! R" which also takes place after the Battle City arc, and is also disputed in its canonicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other works, such as GX, 5Ds, Zexal and Arc-V, are, unlike the original, Anime first before manga, instead of the other way around. These certainly does not encompass the "original one" as you mentioned in your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In chapter 139, we see her in lecture, and her classmate remarks that she's changed lately after Nao comments on a professor's appearance. To me, the classmate's observation that Nao has changed lately, rather than that Nao has suddenly changed after coming to back to lecture after a long absence, best fits in with the scenario where Nao has been regularly attending class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jp2gg.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jp2gg.jpg" alt="ch. 139 excerpt"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the Liar Game rounds do not actually appear to take up that much time, and presumably are spaced out somewhat. If so, it would not be inconceivable that Nao would have been able to go to class regularly even while in the Liar Game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first round takes place over the span of a month, but unlike with the other rounds, there is no set schedule for when players have to act; players would have more flexibility with the timing of their actions. (For instance, players did not have to show up to a game location at a certain time.) Moreover, although, Nao initially coops herself up at home, she is later able to carry on with her daily life: when she and Akiyama take shifts to watch her teacher (ch. 3), Akiyama takes the day shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second round takes place over three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first revival round is &lt;a href="http://liarsgame.wikia.com/wiki/Revival_Round#Game_Outline" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;thirteen hours long&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third round is on a "Saturday the week after next" (per ch. 29) and takes place over a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second revival round takes place on a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth round takes up two days. (The players go into the mansion at night to rest.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third revival round takes place over a single day. (&lt;a href="http://liarsgame.wikia.com/wiki/Revival_Round_III#Game_Outline" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;It should only last a few hours.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final round takes place over a single day. (There is never any mention of giving the players a break for the night.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="9123" Title="Why do fansubbed animes have a reminder to not sell their fansubbed product?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Why do fansubbed animes have a reminder to not sell their fansubbed product? Sometimes they have the following reminder during the show:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;This is a free fansub: not for sale, rent, or auction&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why that was necessary. Is it so that they do not get into legal problems? What is the purpose of that reminder?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9128">&lt;p&gt;Even though in some countries, translations of original works are considered original works themselves, the copyright laws are still pretty vague, and so to avoid getting in trouble, fansub groups add such reminders that could be interpreted as "we did not intend to infringe any rights" if they get sued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if some shady guy tries to sell some dvds, and they contain very explicit markings of a certain fansub group, that group has some protection by stating that they did not intend for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9129">&lt;p&gt;I think it's a combination of a few factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there's a sort of ethical code among some fansubbers that dictates that they fansub for "the love of anime" or something to that effect, and that it's improprietous to profit off of fansubbing. I'm not sure how effective a reminder of this sort would be to people who don't subscribe to the same ethical code (i.e. the people at whom this message would be targeted), but there you have it. Sticking a reminder on your fansubs is pretty much a no-cost endeavor, so it's not like it can hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there's the belief that explicitly stating that you do not intend to profit off of your fansubs makes you less liable for copyright infringement. I doubt this has been tested (I don't know of any litigation against fansubbers), but I rather doubt this would be of much value as a legal defense - statutory damages (as opposed to actual damages) are available in USA copyright infringement cases under federal law (and, I imagine, in other jurisdictions as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect (but have no evidence) that this is a holdover from the pre-Internet days of fansub distribution when you actually needed to pass around video tapes to get your anime fix. Exchanging physical materials is likely to get you more scrutiny from law enforcement than exchanging digital information, and this relates to my previous point: infringing copyright is bad, but profiting off of infringed copyrights is probably worse, or at least that's the general perception. &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/9169/1908"&gt;C. Griffin's answer&lt;/a&gt; to this question contains an interesting view on the matter, from the perspective of someone who consumed fansubs in pre-internet times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9123/why-do-fansubbed-animes-have-a-reminder-to-not-sell-their-fansubbed-product#comment11192_9123"&gt;Adam Davis also brought up in a comment&lt;/a&gt; another point I meant to address - fansubbers don't want &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people profiting off of their work - it's kind of a slap in the face. So what's one way to do that? Stick a big "this is not for sale" warning on it, kind of like how a lot of free (gratis) software comes with a notice saying something like "if you paid for this, you should ask for your money back because this is free software".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's the problem: basically all fansubbing these days is done with "softsubs" - that is, the subtitles are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ass#Advanced_SubStation_Alpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;basically a text file&lt;/a&gt; that accompanies a video. It's dead easy to edit these things (particularly using software like &lt;a href="http://www.aegisub.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Aegisub&lt;/a&gt;), so this is probably another reason that you don't see these disclaimers anymore: they're easy to remove. In the pre-softsub days (maybe before 2008~2010 or so? I don't have my chronology down for this very well), subtitling was done by re-encoding the video to have the subtitles ("hardsubs") baked into the video file. Since this is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more difficult to alter, disclaimers would have been more permanent (and hence, useful) back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I haven't seen a disclaimer of this sort on any fansubs from at least the past five years or so - it's gone the way of the dinosaurs. In the modern fansubbing world, where all exchange of fansubs is electronic and hardsubs are obsolete, these disclaimers serve no actual purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I have seen this sort of thing on recent manga scanlations, though - but that's a topic for another question. The key difference here, I suspect, is that scanlations are still "hardsubbed", so to speak.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9152">&lt;p&gt;I think this is largely to do with Copyright issues. You see those who distribute or offer the file are usually in the wrong and violate Japanese copyright laws. But because copyright highly relies on where you are in the world (speaking geographically) fan operated groups who do these fansubs often get away from this and find a way to "turn the other corner".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is possible to find loopholes such as this, these warnings are often meant to redirect blame if they are sued for infringing on copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9169">&lt;p&gt;I was a &lt;em&gt;consumer&lt;/em&gt; of fansubs in the early-mid 90's. This statement has no bearing on my answer, however, I was pointing it out because someone thought it would be interesting to hear from a pre-Internet fansub consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these answers are valid. Ultimately, the fan sub groups need legal authorities to know that profit is not expected or accepted.  It's a gray area, because the two "products" that we're discussing are the original work (included in a fan sub), and then the translation itself.  The translation can probably be distributed freely, as it is not the same as the original dialogue -- and on its own is an interpretation of a story by a translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iffy part is about the original work being distributed. In most countries, it is illegal to distribute (user-made) copies of copyrighted work without express written consent of the copyright holder. It robs the copyright holder of earnings, blah blah blah. I'm not a legal zealot, and I'm not here to defend any particular side. However, in this day and age, the copyright protections are expected to be upheld in the international community, and enforced by local government or at a higher level -- Interpol.  We don't normally hear about busts like this, because a fansubber usually has a small audience, and many studios secretly find this type of behavior beneficial to increasing their products popularity, and with any luck, profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footnote about the pre-Internet days: We would mail our brand new blank VHS cassettes to fansub groups in postage-paid envelopes so that no money would exchange hands whatsoever. It might take a month or two to get your tapes, but for foreign video that was unreleased domestically, it's what you had to do.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;/backinthedaystories&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9221">&lt;p&gt;I have seen notices that warn that if you have paid money for this fansub you have been ripped off leading me to believe that there have been cases of other parties trying to make money by selling free fansubs and these notices are attempts to stop that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that both shards and drop items (monster parts) can be used for crafting. Drop items not necessarily lead to magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;

 Since Crozzo is reluctant to craft magic items, the weapon he crafted from the minotaur' horn is not a magical item.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Magic Stones are the core of the monsters' life force, and adventurers' means of living. Without exception, it locates in the monster's chest.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Killing the monsters, gouging the Magic Stones out of their chests (in the anime, the body of the monsters disappear when defeated, leaving their Magic Stones behind), and cashing them in at the guild is &lt;strong&gt;the main source of income of the adventurers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, I heard that the movie &lt;em&gt;The Last: Naruto the Movie&lt;/em&gt; came out. From what I have heard, the movie has spoilers about the end of the manga (like chapter 700), but I'm currently not reading the manga (though I plan on starting).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I were to watch the movie, when does the movie take place within &lt;em&gt;Naruto Shippuden&lt;/em&gt;, if at all? I saw somewhere saying that it took place at around episode 399-400, but I also heard that a series following Shippuden is coming, so I don't know if I should watch Shippuden, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the upcoming series, and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; the movie. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20664">&lt;p&gt;The Last: Naruto the Movie takes place two years after the events of the Fourth Shinobi World War, ie two years after Chapter 699.  The last chapter of the manga, Chapter 700, shows events taking place over 10 years after the Fourth Shinobi World War. So the timeline of &lt;strong&gt;The Last&lt;/strong&gt; falls in between chapters 699 and 700. Chronologically, the movie takes place after the Shippuden series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your original question, the current episodes of Naruto:Shippuden series are fillers. So they are not based on the manga and is made specially for the anime.  But removing the filler arc, it is currently at Chapter 662 of Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinch&#363;riki arc. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yamcha&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;blushes&lt;/em&gt; (Internally) Pretend you don't know him...!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulma&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;blushes&lt;/em&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the comparison above, the potty talk was censored in the English Dub. In the end, the reason Roshi wanted to land in the English dub wasn't made clear at all. They didn't even bother coming up with an alternate explanation! If the studio was afraid to air potty jokes on the US airwaves, they should've cut the scene altogether or come up with a new reason (a tummy ache?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Dub being my first exposure to this scene, and considering Roshi's pervy past with his workout videos and lewd magazines (making me assume he's a sex/masturbatory addict), I thought Roshi wanted to land because he was unbearably eager to "relieve" himself after being around the pretty stewardess for so long. The other characters' unexplained blushing only added to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a scene whose meaning was truly lost in translation..&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="43423" Title="What did Oshino Ougi signify?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand what the reveal of Ougi's true nature meant. There were many words, but I only got the sense that she's a (apparition) manifestation of some part of Araragi which he rejected sometime early in the series. I understood that at the end Meme decided to &quot;officially recognize&quot; her existence, but that's not important here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What exactly does Ougi represent?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47440">&lt;p&gt;Ougi is actually manifestation Araragi's self-doubt. She, or he, is one part of Araragi where she always tries to reveal hidden/missing parts of Araragi's history. In one episode she claims to punishing liars which is essentially Araragi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another proof I can gave is her own catchphrase which I love. "I don't know anything, Araragi-senpai. It's you who knows."&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47801">&lt;p&gt;Ougi is Araragi's youthful foolishness manifested as persistent self-doubt and lack of love for himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea is transient throughout the occurrences of Ougi. She initially spawned after the events of Shinobu Time. That's when Araragi registers the idea that he could criticise himself just like how the Darkness criticises the world as the "principles of the universe". After her creation, Ougi spars with Araragi, nudging out fears and doubts he has had about his decisions and actions. He wants to make himself feel guilty for the events of the series because he chose to save Kiss-shot, Senjou, etc. This was the main theme for the Sodachi arc, in which Ougi was actually right, that he knew the reason for Sodachi's suffering all along but hadn't acted. Of course, this isn't always the case. Why was this important in the entire series? Because Ougi had the ability to undo what she thought were the mistakes that Araragi had made, even when the mistakes were natural to make; Gaen's gang knew this. There are some plotholes though, but those will be up to your interpretation of the story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Ougi being his lack of love for himself an important developmental point in Owarimonogatari 2. In Bakemonogatari, his lack of love for himself allowed him to be so selfless in saving the 5 girls that it caught even Meme off-guard, which is a reason why Meme left, sensing that an abberation like Ougi might appear. Throught the series, Araragi gets beaten and cut up in many ways to save others. In Owari 2, Araragi also foreshadows his inability to love himself in Hitagi Rendezvous even when he was able to love Senjou. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His development was in the subsequent arc where he saved Ougi from the darkness. Choosing to sever his arm to save Ougi was the ultimate act of loving himself, to finally hurt for no one but himself. This was when Meme finally comes back, to signify that this huge Arc that started with Bakemono has come to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ougi also tries to sabotage the relationships between Araragi and the girls. I'm not sure whether this has been explained so I will only speculate that I feel this is because Ougi reflects Araragi's childish mantra that "friends decrease my power as a human". Another hint that Ougi is Araragi's childish foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ougi Dark is really similar to Suruga Devil and Tsubasa Tiger. They are stories about growing up by recognizing a part of themselves. Araragi recognises that he is someone who can criticise himself and hate himself, Kanbaru sees the fears she has harboured reflected within Numachi and Hanekawa embraces her imperfections (jealousy in this arc). Accepting this as a natural part of growing up brought the stories to their conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="20851" Title="Why did the Uchihas never try to learn Sage Mode?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Jiraiya, Naruto, Hashirama and Kabuto were able to enter into Sage Mode. One who enters Sage Mode possesses more abilities than a normal ninja. Why did the Uchihas never try to learn Sage Mode? Is it because of the Sage of Six Paths dividing his power among his sons?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20863">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sage_Mode" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sage Mode&lt;/a&gt; requires a large chakra pool. Most Uchihas can't learn it because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Fukasaku, only those who already possess "extreme chakra levels" can utilise natural energy to invoke senjutsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26786">&lt;h2&gt;The Uchiha never tried learning Sage Mode, because, they never wanted it in the first place.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the Uchiha don't have a large chakra pool. But that couldn't be the only reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first quality that comes into mind when taking the Uchiha clan for analysis, is &lt;strong&gt;pride&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uchiha's pride stems from their battle skills, dexterity, intelligence and most importantly, their prized Sharingan. The joy of the clan members when a Sharingan develops in someone, is boundless. They keep the Sharingan in &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high regard and consider it as the ultimate weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the amount of consideration and importance the Uchiha gives to the Sharingan, it is highly likely that they felt there was no need for any external enhancement jutsu, such as Sage Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another (incomplete) reason could be the Sage of Six Paths. He was the only other person Indra Otsutsuki despised (other than Asura). And the Sage Mode being something that stemmed out from the Rikudo Sennin, that hatred indirectly and unknowingly influenced Indra's descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36796">&lt;p&gt;All of the people whom you mentioned (Naruto, Jiraiya, and Kabuto) were taught Senjutsu even though they were eager or not. Not sure about Hashirama because it was never mentioned in the anime or manga, but Orochimaru wanted to learn it and failed. You see, whether it is the giant snake, the great elder frog, or some guy from the Hidden Woods, where Hashirama must have learnt Senjutsu, should decide to teach you the Senjutsu. Some Uchihas would have tried and failed or gotten rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44013">&lt;p&gt;Other than the good theories everybody else have already listed, my guess is: except Madara, Uchiha clan only focus on abilities and knowledge that came from their doujustu rather than look outside of their clan's specialties. This limit was something that made Madara, then later Obito, Itachi, and Sasuke stronger and different from their clan history later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the whole length of &lt;em&gt;Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; has been the creator wanking out powers for the Uchiha whole way 700 chapters through. Did he really need to give them &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; power they really don't need?&lt;/p&gt;

Based on this, I would like to give a try to answer my own question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I do understand that manga and anime of &lt;em&gt;Arpegio of Blue Steel&lt;/em&gt; is completely different story but some concepts overlap and there is a possibility that manga-based explanation would work for anime too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In manga, Osakabe Tojurou gave Makie false memories about her past and her family. According to them, Makie had a grandpa, whom was deeply attached emotionally to. Tojurou used the opportunity that I-401 departed from Yokosuka port (2 years before original plot) and tuned the false memories that her grandpa wend aboard and did never return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Makie heard somehow that I-401 arrived back in the port and planned escape from mansion in order &lt;strong&gt;to see her grandpa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact that can help confirm the hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She appeared near the same Hangars when found Kirishima's core and Haruna. It was on her way to Yokosuka port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact that can help deny the hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In manga, her stuffed bear named Yotarou was gift given by grandpa. In anime we can see photos that she received it from Tojurou himself.&lt;/li&gt;

But still he offered himself to the government so that they could turn him to a complete Pacifista.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8246">&lt;p&gt;Maybe he was an informant for Dragon but he was too honorable to betray the government bluntly.
We know that he was a man of reason when he let Zoro take up all the pain instead of Luffy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him becoming Pacifista was entirely for different reasons which we still don't know.
He offered himself to be experimented upon but his last wish was to protect thousand sunny which was honoured and his wish was fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I believe almost all of the people watching anime or reading manga get them from various sites like watchop.com, Crunchyroll, anime44, etc., and similarly for manga there are various sites. But are these episodes/chapters really free of cost for the audience? I know that these companies have their major source of income from merchandise and all other stuff but the episodes/chapters are available on net so easily that too for free. Aren't there any copyright violations? If there are why don't these anime/manga companies do something about it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9218">&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are some legitimate websites on which you can read manga and watch anime for free. &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; is one of them. While Crunchyroll &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-11/video-site-with-unauthorized-anime-gets-us$4m-venture" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;started out&lt;/a&gt; as a site that streamed anime without licenses (i.e. illegally), they are now fully legitimate and above-board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Crunchyroll has to pay for licenses for the anime they stream - the producers over in Japan aren't just going to give it away for free. So how does Crunchyroll make money? I don't claim to know Crunchyroll's business model, but (as &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/21/crunchyroll-expands-its-revenue-stream-by-selling-anime-related-merch/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; points out), they have venture funding, and they sell &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/premium_comparison" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;premium memberships&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/store" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;anime-related merchandise&lt;/a&gt;. They also show ads to non-members. Lots of websites follow a business model in which users get lots of functionality for free - for example, this one! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aren't there any copyright violations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other sites you mention - "watchop.com" and "anime44.com" do not appear to be licensed purveyors of anime, so in their case, yes - they are probably infringing on the copyright of the owners over in Japan. They presumably aren't paying the licensors in Japan a dime, so it's not surprising that they can (illegally) show anime for free. You probably shouldn't use those sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If there are why don't these anime/manga companies do something about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to quote from Logan's answer &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6472/1908"&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'll also point out that while fansubbers and scanalators are almost certainly legally in the wrong, the number of cases related to this is quite small. There are several reasons for this. &lt;strong&gt;For one, the Japanese industry is built to sell merchandise in Japan, so they have little interest in prosecuting cases overseas.&lt;/strong&gt; The licensing industry, on the other hand, was built around an already extant culture of fansubbing, and so they've always just factored that in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if I'm remembering correctly (and please, do correct me if I'm wrong; I'll try to dig up sources for this later), anime licensing deals are typically a flat fee - the licensees outside Japan pay the licensors in Japan a fixed amount in exchange for the right to stream the anime, or sell physical copies, or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the licensors don't care &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; times the anime is streamed or sold or whatever - they've already got their share, and if piracy reduces the number of people outside Japan that watch the anime on Crunchyroll or whatever, oh well! It's not their problem at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9219">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes anime streaming is free, but mostly it is usually geographically monitored. E.g. Hulu uses geographical blocking to stop people from other countries and regions outside of the USA from streaming content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason they have this is due to probably copyright issues. Sites like anime44 are usually considered illegal sites, but because copyright varies of many factors including location it is usually hard to shut down sites like anime44.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said in the comments they are usually free because sites such as Crunchyrolls often get income from Premium Membership Users and products/merchandise that they sell on there site including Koruko No Basket figurines and much, much more. It is also most likely that they earn money from clicks on ads, or on how many people view ads in between the animes that you see for free. It is also likely that they might have sponsors too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: One thing that these site infringe on is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;users are entitled to several protections of their own. A user is
  entitled to make a reproduction for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatley there are some complications to this since if you are in a country where Copyright laws arent the same or enforced then people can get away with this, and if they are streaming it online to everyone one around the world, then it isn't exactly for personal use then is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the comparison above, the potty talk was censored in the English Dub. In the end, the reason Roshi wanted to land in the English dub wasn't made clear at all. They didn't even bother coming up with an alternate explanation! If the studio was afraid to air potty jokes on the US airwaves, they should've cut the scene altogether or come up with a new reason (a tummy ache?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Dub being my first exposure to this scene, and considering Roshi's pervy past with his workout videos and lewd magazines (making me assume he's a sex/masturbatory addict), I thought Roshi wanted to land because he was unbearably eager to "relieve" himself after being around the pretty stewardess for so long. The other characters' unexplained blushing only added to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a scene whose meaning was truly lost in translation..&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="16684" Title="What kind of sword did Assassin use?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm on episode 7 of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works, where Assassin has shown up. From what I have read, his sword is a long katana, but it doesn't have a tsuba (hand guard). As far as I know about katana, they can have shirasaya (mountings without tsuba), but they weren't used for battle. Was the sword just a katana that they didn't bother to put a tsuba on for stylistic reasons, or was it actually a different kind of sword?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzJ9U.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="16692">&lt;p&gt;An exact solution is not traceable... The closest katana is a &lt;strong&gt;Nodachi&lt;/strong&gt; (&#22823;&#22826;&#20992;) without a Tsuba &#37716; (Handguard) and with a blue/light yellow decorated Tsuka &#26564; (Hilt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you mentioned in your question it could also be a shirasaya &#30333;&#38808;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Shirasaya actually contains two plain wooden parts. The Saya &#12373;&#12420; (Scabbard) and the Tsuka. These parts are used to store a katana blade and prevent it from corroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shirasaya Tsuka is actually not made to be used in combat because of the missing Tsuba &#37716; (Hand guard). I also do not think that a storage tsuba is fixed strong enough to the blade to use it for fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NevhO.png" alt="Shirasaya"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore there is also a Shikomizue &#20181;&#36796;&#12415;&#26454; that general also do not have a tsuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Shikomizue is actually a sword hidden in a stick. Propose of such a stick is to hide the sword from the public because it was not allowed to openly carry a sword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/md1yL.png" alt="Shikomizue"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition they are mostly decorated because it should look nice and unobtrusively like the tsuka of &lt;em&gt;Monohoshizao&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway it is rather be a Nodachi because of length and it is also slightly curved. Just without a hand guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Why would our everyday lives get turned into an anime?!"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Because a drama CD can't convey that wonderful face you make when you act the straight man."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"It'll be fun, though. It'll be like the ending of &lt;em&gt;Demon-Lord Hero Legend Wataru.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"I don't think I was even born when that was on the air!"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"You say that, but I see your Kyocera phone. The prospect is so on your mind."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is from Chapter 09, p.142 on the English translation published by Vertical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koyomi claims to be young enough not to know about a show from the late 80s, but Oshino makes the point that he's using an old man's phone (probably refers to a flip-phone, compared to the more modern smartphones; remember how Kaiki suffered when Senjougahara broke his phone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting point is that Koyomi is probably telling the truth: several sources point to the timeline of the show occurring around 2006-2007, and he would not have been born by 1989 when &lt;em&gt;Demon-Lord Hero Legend Wataru&lt;/em&gt; finished airing.&lt;/p&gt;

But didn't Light know Mello's face?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's mentioned that no matter how exact the drawings are, you can't see the names of the person with the Shinigami Eyes.

Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Light knew how Mello looked like.

</answer><answer Id="18960">&lt;p&gt;Light did see Mihael's face when his dad Soichiro confronted Mello at the mafia place (episode 29 in the anime). The Japanese task force had cameras on them when they infiltrated  Mello's hideout. Since Light knew his name and saw his face, he could've killed Mello at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this would make Light seem more suspicious as the only person with a death note at the time was his father and the only people who knew how Mello looked like were the people on the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Near said he couldn't contact Mello because he didn't know where he was, so Light could've conceivably made Mello disappear in the same way he did with the Naomi Misora.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="53673">&lt;p&gt;In the anime there is evidence there were cameras when the police intervened in the Mafia place. Light tells police at the scene they have to keep searching for Mello because none of the gangsters at the scene looks like the drawing of Mello's face made by the girl. It didn't look like they were sending phone pictures. There must have been cameras, and when the building explodes, we can see Light watching the screens with the transmission interrupted. The only way to justify that Light didn't know Mello's face is because his father takes off his helmet (where the camera most probably was placed) in front of Mello, a strange decision since he didn't need to do that to recognize Mello's face and his name and lifespan. Another explanation can be that Soichiro didn't want his action of killing a criminal through the Death Note recorded in his helmet's camera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shiganshina District was the first city to fall when Wall Maria was
  breached, leading to a massive slaughter and &lt;strong&gt;prompting humanity to
  abandon the entire perimeter and the remaining cities along the Wall&lt;/strong&gt;
  as they attempted to consolidate their losses. After the fall of Wall
  Maria, humanity was pushed into Wall Rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, they are empty. Probably not as damaged as Shiganshina but considering most of the loss in human lives was due the insufficiency of evacuation vacancies, it's fair to say, people might have met a slower and more prolongued, but equally bloody, end as those in Shiganshina.&lt;/p&gt;

I do not think she would think that unless she knew Conan well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="42828">&lt;p&gt;Akemi Miyano actually was in a previous case, in episode 13, "The Strange Person Hunt Murder Case."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the anime didn't do that episode according to the manga, so they had to change some things later to make the show follow the correct storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a summary from &lt;a href="http://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/The_Strange_Person_Hunt_Murder_Case" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Detective Conan World Wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the manga version of the story Gin and Vodka are the masterminds of the case (rather than Okita), and they end up killing Masami Hirota/Akemi Miyano who informs Conan of the organization's existence and that they dress in black. Her death is the motive of Shiho Miyano's defection which leads to Ai Haibara's appearance later in the series. Furthermore, Shiho makes a silhouetted appearance when Akemi is demanding for herself and her sister to be free of the organization, which is also omitted. To repair the storyline, Episode 128 The Black Organization: One Billion Yen Robbery Case was written with a similar ending to the manga version.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I really like the &quot;Meitantei Conan&quot; anime, but I've always wanted to know, why is was the name translated to &quot;Case Closed&quot; when it was localized? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="32514">&lt;p&gt;Whether or not &lt;em&gt;Detective Conan&lt;/em&gt; was catchy enough isn't the cause for the change in name in this particular case...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point Funimation's "Case Closed" website had a FAQ page with this question asked. An archival copy of this page can be found &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040327142351/http://caseclosed.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did you change the name to Case Closed?&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to legal considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the same vague response in a 2004 &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-02-05/funimation-renames-conan"&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt; published by Anime News Network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;FUNimation sent out an advisory today stating that due to unspecified legal considerations, Detective Conan is to be renamed "Case Closed" . . . Due to legal considerations, this highly anticipated series will be released in the United States as Case Closed. Working closely with our Japanese partners, Case Closed was chosen as the name best suited for the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seems to be mostly speculation, there have been &lt;a href="http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=107;t=000637;p=1"&gt;forum posts&lt;/a&gt; mentioning that this renaming is due to the copyright held by DC Comics on the name Conan. I'm not convinced by that reasoning, but I included it for you to digest as you please.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40182">&lt;p&gt;For starters, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan is a name in the US that is closely associated with Conan the Barberian, and Conan is a name that sounds rather odd, the main reason why Japanese names are almost always changed in the US, e.g Kudo Shinichi to Jimmy Kudo. I believe the main reason other than that is probably for a more eye-catching name than simply Detective Conan.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="53725">&lt;p&gt;What other people said is correct but I also believe they mention the phrase "Case Closed" in multiple episodes of the TV show/Anime so I guess whoever titled was like, that would make a pretty good title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3MtQ.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we take Episode 1 into consideration, we can see that Wretched Egg attacks Ganta and kills off his class mates. This is also what seems to be when Ganta should be receiving his powers. In that case, since Wretched Egg's powers have the hexagonal patterns around his/her abilities, then this would explain why Ganta has the same design, since Ganta got his abilities from Wretched Egg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese label is &lt;code&gt;&#27833;&#24425;&#21093;&#38626;&#21092;&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_stripper" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;paint stripper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The principal active ingredient in historically common solvent paint strippers is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloromethane" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;dichloromethane&lt;/a&gt;, also called methylene chloride, which has serious health risks including death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of acute overexposure to dichloromethane via inhalation include: difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DCM is also metabolized by the body to carbon monoxide potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

So how is it that he remembers how to activate it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4460">&lt;p&gt;I don't know how far the anime is yet, so I'll put it into a spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The shift between human is triggered by any injury that causes blood loss. The first shift is triggered when Eren gets eaten by one of the titans and hurts his arm. To trigger the next one, he bites himself to protect Mikasa and Armin. Apparently, also the will to accomplish something is needed to become a titan (kill the titans, save his friends)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6839">&lt;p&gt;Rober English when eren has to turn into a titan he has to inflict damage on himself and have a clear goal so i'm guessing that when eren was a child he never had a goal like block the cannon or kill the titans&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13265">&lt;p&gt;I would imagine in order to transform the first time that you would have to be in very clear danager and would subconsciesly desire the change. He didn't have any concept that he could and something like getting cut on a tree would certainly not be dangerous enough to warrent the subconsciese into activating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would wager though that once he changed the first time and figure out he could do it it bacame much easier because he knew he could. It would be like discovering a secret talent that you had (wiggling your ears or something). You technically could always do it but without strong reason (someone telling you to try) you would never knew you could. Once you discovered you could, it would be much easier to access. (sorry if that's a bad example, not a lot of parallels to turning into a titan :p )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea (though less likely imo) is that age has something to do with it. Maybe you have to mature to a certain point before it's possible. It just happened that he was finally of age/ ability at that point to turn and, with the obvious situation of being eaten, could at that point turn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First one being so that Kaneki doesn't go insane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep him mentally aware so that he constantly feels pain instead of trying to ignore it. By keeping him mentally engaged it prevents Kaneki from ignoring the constant pain cycle (although he later goes on to say that it helped him keep his mind on something else besides the pain - linking back to bullet 1, keeping him sane)&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="18689" Title="Why do many visual novels contain erotic content?" Body="&lt;p&gt;After watching/reading anime and manga, I recently started going into visual novels. One thing that struck me was the fact that erotic content (aka H-scenes) seems to be quite common in the world of visual novels. Examples: Fate/stay night, Muv-Luv Alternative, G-senjou no Maou. Can anyone explain this higher prevalence of erotic content in visual novels, as compared to anime and manga?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18706">&lt;p&gt;Because visual novels are spinoff of eroge games. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroge"&gt;According to wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eroge game (or H-game, hentai game) are introduced into the market (no pun intended) in the 1980's as a means to attract users to the (game maker) company computer platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1992 the dating sim / love simulators were born, when a company designed the game so the player had to win the affection of the character before gaining access to the H-scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first use of the term visual novel is in 1996, and from there the erotic material became optional, with the introduction of the all ages versions of the visual novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still adhering to tradition, the visual novels of today still have the H content, though not every one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to the wikipedia article to more in-depth historical facts, including game titles and company names.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18709">&lt;p&gt;I upvoted @Mindwin's answer because the answer's content is, to my knowledge, absolutely correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to clarify a little more: in the period 1980&amp;ndash;1996 or so, the kinds of games that we'd call visual novels nowadays were a lot more like hentai anime. The stories were usually fairly simple and pretty much revolved around a character talking girls into sleeping with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the different types of games mentioned in Mindwin's answer started to converge on each other. My impression, and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroge"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; implies the same thing, is that the first eroge which prioritized story over sex was Kanon. In Kanon, the sex scenes can be totally excised from the story without much loss; they're essentially what the authors of &lt;a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0061357952"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Not to Write a Novel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; call "benevolent tumors". Pretty soon, other games, such as Type Moon's Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night, did the same thing and made a game with a deep and interesting story that only incidentally contained sex scenes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we're at the point where some prominent visual novels, such as Clannad, have no erotic content at all. Others, such as Little Busters, are released without erotic content and later re-released with erotic content added in. The modern visual novel is sort of an evolutionary crossover between the original eroge, which always had eroticism, and the renai games like Tokimeki Memorial that usually didn't. Its lineage contains games with erotic content, so visual novels are more accepting of erotic content than more mainstream forms like anime and manga. (As Memor-X points out, this is also somewhat inherent to the nature of the media; anime are broadcast on TV and manga are sold in bookstores, so it's harder to sell anime and manga with sexual content unless they have no other purpose for existing.) But because the sexual content of visual novels is typically easy to remove, and because the stories are often unique and compelling, it's common to simply remove the sex scenes and adapt them to anime and manga.&lt;/p&gt;

My reasoning for the same would be&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Grey Eyes&lt;/i&gt; are similar to that of &lt;I&gt;Zamasu's&lt;/i&gt;. Since Goku Black is basically Zamasu, Goku black's eyes would've intentionally been colored grey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you look at even the &lt;i&gt;Super Saiyan transformations&lt;/i&gt;, the color of Goku's eyes are Green, blue or red and it depends on the animation/animators of that episode. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Whenever &lt;i&gt;Goku Black's eyes are pink&lt;/i&gt;, it is when he's powered up(In the sense, his aura is glowing).

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Rebuild of Evangelion, the first movie is almost an exact retelling of the original anime series.

I am asking you to compare the rebirth movies to the original series, script or storyline-wise, and backtrack the visible differences to their sources, pointing to a specific event that happened onscreen or was mentioned that may be the cause of those differences, looking backwards for the cause of that other event. Pepper your answer with references, please.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You may add a few speculations in making your chain of causality, if the events have a significant impact or relation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14116">&lt;p&gt;I've only seen up to the second movie. However, if i was to make a guess, it would be what Kaji gave to Gendo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original one, it was a &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Adam#Design" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Adam's Embryo&lt;/a&gt;, while in Rebuild it's &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar%27s_Key" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nebuchadnezzar's Key&lt;/a&gt;. I'd say its discovery (before the first movie) is what would be turning point, but a noticeable difference didn't occur until Kaji went to deliver it to Gendo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original series, &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Gaghiel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gaghiel&lt;/a&gt; attacked the UN Pacific Fleet searching for Adam's embryo, but that never happened in Rebuild. Rather, &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Ramiel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ramiel&lt;/a&gt; became the new 6th Angel, while Gaghiel never appears. Instead, we have the unnamed &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Third_Angel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Third Angel&lt;/a&gt; which, if you account for the fact it was subjected to experiments, is reminiscent of Gaghiel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Kaji released the Third Angel to cover his escape with Nebuchadnezzar's Key, so it's possible that the facility that the Third Angel was in was where Gaghiel attacked before the first movie. Gaghiel may have been captured and experimented on, and became the Third Angel we see in the second movie (thus making &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Sachiel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sachiel&lt;/a&gt; the Fourth Angel). Kaji knew that by releasing the Third Angel, the facility will do everything they can to prevent its escape from the facility, and in the end, they destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd also note that Sachiel, &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Shamshel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Shamshel&lt;/a&gt; and Ramiel are very much the same since the first movie was more of less the same as the original (very little deviation), except their numbers have been pushed up thanks to the Third Angel appearing in the second movie (and numbering seems to be based off appearance) - from the &lt;a href="http://evangelion.wikia.com/wiki/Seventh_Angel" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Seventh Angel&lt;/a&gt; on they are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/14118/1587"&gt;Jon Lin's Answer&lt;/a&gt; talks about Lilith which I totally forgot about. However, both Rebuild's references to Lilith in the first movie and the original series references to her would still occur &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the item Kaji gave to Gendo was discovered (Original = "Adam's Embryo", Rebuild = "Nebuchadnezzar's Key"), and as such I stand by my speculations.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14118">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.evageeks.org/Differences_between_Evangelion_1.0_and_Neon_Genesis_Evangelion"&gt;Here's a list of differences between the first movie and the original timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable plot-wise is that Misato knew about Lilith, and she knew what Lilith's purpose was, and later before the Ramiel battle, she showed Shinji what Lilith was and explained why he needed to fight the Angels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The appearance and identification of the Angel Lilith at the end of the first movie and just before the commencement of Operation Yashima (Corresponding to Episode 06 of the TV series), unlike the veil of secrecy kept in the original series where Lilith was never seen until Episode 15 and wrongly identified as Adam until Episode 24.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;More notably, Gendo and Fuyutsuki speak about a "&lt;strong&gt;contract with Lilith&lt;/strong&gt;," which did not exist in the old series. Lilith's existence may not be a mystery, but its role is hinted to take a different turn from its original series counterpart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no mention of a "contract" with Lilith in the original time-line.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14150">&lt;p&gt;I think one of the biggest changing points is &lt;a href="http://wiki.evageeks.org/Vatican_Treaty"&gt;the Vatican Treaty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the wiki points, this represents a weakened political influence by the part of Seele. Comparing the roles of Seele in both continuities, in NGE they are the masterminds, but in Rebuild they are more like an advisory board (going even to the extreme of shutting themselves down peacefully, instead of having the plug pulled by Gendo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vatican Treaty may have arised from a stronger nationalism to fill the vacuum left by Seele's reduced influence. Since Asuka identifies more as a German (even being part Japanese), this reduced the bonding between her and Shinji and probably supressed whatever crush she had on Kaji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But keeping with the Rebuild continuity, there were no need to a fourth pilot, so Toji Suzuhara was never recruited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://wiki.evageeks.org/Bardiel"&gt;Bardiel&lt;/a&gt; attacked, the one inside the plug was Asuka, not Toji. The bond between Shinji and the person trapped was smaller, and the psychological damage from the fight was also smaller. Toji was Shinji's friend as much as in NGE, but Asuka was, instead of a love interest, just some annoying female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vacuum in Shinji's love interest created by Asuka disinterest had him gravitate more towards Rei. So the psychological reaction to having Rei "dying" while fighting &lt;a href="http://wiki.evageeks.org/Zeruel"&gt;Zeruel&lt;/a&gt; had the added impact that was missing during the fight with Bardiel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of just going into &lt;a href="http://wiki.evageeks.org/Synchronization"&gt;400% synchro&lt;/a&gt; like in NGE, Shinji causes the &lt;a href="http://wiki.evageeks.org/Third_Impact#Near_Third_Impact"&gt;awakening of EVA-01&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that in both scenarios, EVA-01 ends up bearing both fruits (in NGE she eats Zeruel S2 engine, while in Rebuild the liquified Zeruel-Rei merges with EVA-01), becoming the forbidden godlike being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think the root cause (as far as we can go from what is shown in the Movies) might have been the Vatican Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Ninjas in Naruto &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c2vgJ6b.gif&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; with their hands at the back (which is very different from &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9KBX1DB.gif&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;normal anime character running&lt;/a&gt;). Why is that? Is it because of their too much running speed or the wind force that their arms tend to be at their backs? Don't they lose balance when they run like that? Is there any explanation for this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4223">&lt;p&gt;The shortest and most &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaRun"&gt;sensible answer&lt;/a&gt; I could find is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The standard Ninja Run is this:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body tilted forward, low to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One forearm crooked in front of the body, apparently to block attacks (two fingers held in front of the mouth
  optional but prevalent).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The other arm behind the back, ready to pull out a bladed weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another speculative guess would be better aerodynamics. Also they move very quickly at times and it is said that &lt;a href="http://running.about.com/od/howtorun/tp/runningform.htm"&gt;swinging your arms&lt;/a&gt; make you tire faster and give you bad form, so it could be to save energy.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4238">&lt;p&gt;Based on research...
...Ninjas frequently were portrayed running with &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirplaneArms"&gt;The Airplane Arms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ninja are also frequently portrayed running this way (with the arms swept farther back, like the wings on an F-14 Tomcat), though they now tend to prefer the Ninja Run. Samurai also run in a similar manner, usually while keeping one hand grasped onto their katana. &lt;strong&gt;In a more (apparently) realistic series this may have something to do with the runner having a reduced profile and thus being harder to hit with ranged weaponry, but it's generally just the Rule Of Cool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasis by me.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5337">&lt;p&gt;When they keep their arms behind, they are streamlined.
They penetrate through air faster and air resistance is reduced, and hence it boosts their speed.
It also provides easy accessibility to weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5406">&lt;p&gt;The reason they do that is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Aerodynamics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less air resistance, faster speed. Used a lot when designing jets, planes, cars. You want something to be faster, you either make it more powerful or have the resistance against it cut. Speed was important to ninjas so wearing tight clothes and running in an aerodynamic position would make them faster. That is in addition to obvious benefits that people have stated (a hand at the ready to draw a blade...etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder about the shape of submarines or torpedoes? Its cause its hydrodynamic. Faster speed due to less resistance from the water. It works the same for air resistance. NASA used to have a great page on aerodynamics but obviously it is no longer available (can't even be crawled due to robots.txt for the site).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5612">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's because the weapons they'd use to handle an ambush are drawn from their thighs and behind their backs. I'd think it would also give them a uniform running profile so that there is no 'best moment' to attack them. If you run with your arms swinging there will be moments when your hands are completely out of position. Especially if you have, say, a left thigh shuriken holster and a right shoulder sword draw then you will constantly be creating a moment where you can easily draw neither weapon due to arm swing. Thirdly it allows you to draw and throw weapons hidden in your sleeve without the delay of needing to swing your arm back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it could also be an artifact of chakra assisted movement. A proper calisthenic running style might conflict with getting the best results from a run that relies more on sticking with chakra and explosively releasing it for a 'push' rather than the rounder motion of running based off pure athleticism. Perhaps it also helps their moment to moment balance by keeping their center of gravity near constant rather than allowing it to sway, that would theoretically allow for faster, tighter reactions and evasions.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5733">&lt;p&gt;Because putting your hands behind your back while running makes you go faster. Because it's weighing you down in the back but your weighing yourself down in the front, So it's like your trying to keep your balance but the front has more weight than the back so when your running your also kind of leaning forward at the same time which makes you run faster giving you more speed. That's why ninja do this so they have more speed.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7257">&lt;p&gt;Actually, I once saw a bit about this in a Japanese TV show.  It comes from the way samurai used to run before meeting the English.  Samurai ran into battle using only their legs, keeping the upper body stable and in a ready stance.  The arms back thing was, I believe, an extension of this having to do with a belief that it cut down on air resistance.  (like using the same technique to run through water)  But one thing that happened when the English arrived is that each saw how the other ran and, as men will do, competed.  The Western style of running is harder to do with a weapon in hand but is more efficient and therefor faster.  The eastern style has no swinging of the arms, which allows larger weapons (swords) to be carried safely, but also requires the shift in weight to occur in the body rather than the arms, making it less efficient and slower.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7608">&lt;p&gt;It obviously doesn't ACTUALLY make you run faster.  If it did, you would see it in the Olympics.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any additional aerodynamics isn't made up for by the loss of swinging momentum of the arms and the awkwardness that causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a reason people swing their arms when they walk/run, even though it uses significantly more energy to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I thought perhaps the reason you would see this run is that maybe it used less energy and helped for distance, but that is unlikely too, because it is probably more work to keep balance overall---and there are people who can basically run so long that what they have to stop for is sleep anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7649">&lt;p&gt;Several reasons really that I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reduce the profile, leaning forward the way they do and keeping the arms straight makes for a harder target to hit and lower to the ground so its more difficult to see moving from cover to cover, which is a Ninja's main objective; to move stealthily.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.5 This also gives them the perfect posture to leap forward for whatever reason since most attacks from behind are hard to block compared to a forward attacks which will have a reasonable amount of time to see and intercept them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An easier/quicker access to weapons, which are attached to the thighs and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased aerodynamics. Running at a fast speed like most Ninja do creates a lot of drag, the more aerodynamic the posture the better.  I can also think of several balance issues that come from running face first like that, the arms held behind the body fix these balance issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can achieve a faster speed.  Technically...  With all the weight moving forward like that it acts like a lead weight on the front of a toy racecar. The force above and ahead of the main pivot of the legs increases the speed.  Inversely this makes things harder to control, but, given that Ninja are basically Jesus and can walk on water and vertical surfaces like walking on flat ground, it makes sense that they have amazing leg strength/balance and can stop on a dime relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improves correct sneaking posture.  Most Ninja are taught to be stealthy, but learning a toe heel posture that emphasizes stealth takes a lot of practice and is hard to maintain.  Leaning forward as they do while running forces the body into a toe heel posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.5 This early academy training idea also has a good grounding on why most adult Ninja in later chapters use the "one hand behind and one hand forward with a hand sign" running style. They've already learned the correct posture to run and sneak with, now they can keep a hand forward, ready to cast the Jutsu they learned during their time as Genin, alongside their proper sneak/running posture.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8773">&lt;p&gt;The reasoning for this is most likely because it looks cool and fits what westerners thinks of when they think of ninjas. There may be some reasoning with weapons but I do not know of any. However it has nothing to do with aerodynamics, physics or speed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprinters use their arms because it makes them faster. Leaning forward while running does not make one faster it actually slows you down because you are in front of your bodies natural center of balance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also does not aid in long distance running. Humans have evolved for bipedal movement because it is more energy saving and efficient way of moving because of the center of gravity and swinging of the arms while walking and running. This is why humans were able to prosper in our early developer because while other quadrupedal animals exhausted themselves while fleeing humans where able to run longer distance, though at a slower rate than other animals to tire them out. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Reading a recent email from Viz Media about Pokemon Season 1 I was reminded of something. in the first season when Ash is traveling his home region of Kanto they refer to the Pokemon League as the Indigo League but when Ash goes to the other regions like Johto, Shinnoh and Hoenn the League name is that of the region.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P9kDa.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P9kDa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Viz Media Image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why is the Kanto League called the Indigo League and not the Kanto League?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43326">&lt;p&gt; Firstly, you can refer to it both as the Kanto League or the Indigo League but the main reason it's called the Indigo League is that it is situated on the Indigo Plateau. There isn't any other reason why it's called the same. Also, the Kanto grand festival happens at the same location so it isn't explicitly a location for the Pokemon league. I believe the main reason for calling it the same and not doing it in the later on seasons is probably because this was the first iteration of the anime and the writers could very likely have put more thought into it as it was the first time the concept was introduced. In the later on seasons it was just a recycled concept, which could possibly explain the simplicity with the names.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43338">&lt;p&gt;While it is more commonly known as the &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Indigo_League" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Indigo League&lt;/a&gt;, the names "Indigo League" and "Kanto League" are simply synonymous&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Depending on the context, the Indigo League can also be called the Kanto League or simply the Pok&#233;mon League&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after doing some research on Bulbapedia, I found the reasoning to why "Kanto League" is known as the "Indigo League"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Generation I games, the final area of the game is called "Indigo Plateau" which lead to many players assuming the Pok&#233;mon League for this region was called the "Indigo League". The reason why the name "Kanto League" wasn&#8217;t considered was because &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kanto&lt;/a&gt; wasn&#8217;t commonly known at the time. &#8220;Kanto&#8221; was only ever mentioned once in the Generation I games, and not mentioned outside of Japan until Generation II games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Until the release of Pok&#233;mon Gold and Silver, Kanto's name was seen only once in the Japanese Generation I games: upon viewing the Town Map at Blue's house. It was never mentioned in the Generation I games outside of Japan, and thus many fans assumed the region was called "Indigo", based on the name of the Indigo Plateau. By the time the Generation III remakes, Pok&#233;mon FireRed and LeafGreen, were released, Kanto's name was firmly established and appeared regularly in-game&lt;/p&gt;

And if so, which ones have it and how sexual is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to watch the shows with my little brother and I just want to make sure there's nothing like that in it before we start it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53642">&lt;p&gt;For the portion you're concerned with
IMDB states the following-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some characters (including children) do appear fully naked in bath scenes. Breasts are visible on female characters, and penises are visible on two child characters in one bath scene. There is a scene where one male child character rubs the chest of a female child character, though this is more comedic than sensual.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There is implied to be a romantic interest between many characters on the show, but nothing sexual is even shown (or for that matter, hardly even implied.)&lt;/p&gt;

I couldn't find a full version (if it even exists) and I'm starting to suspect that this actually is the fullest version, and it's called like that as a joke. Comments to youtube videos suggest the same, but I don't trust them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there any official confirmation that this is indeed the whole track, or is there a longer version somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the many youtube videos:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL0fFXO8apM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL0fFXO8apM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27148">&lt;p&gt;Well, the track is #22 on &lt;a href="http://vgmdb.net/album/22219" rel="nofollow"&gt;the RUINS album&lt;/a&gt; (in Japanese, the track is titled &#12300;&#20104;&#26399;&#12379;&#12396;&#20986;&#26469;&#20107;&#12301; &lt;em&gt;Yoki Senu Dekigoto&lt;/em&gt;). The associated album scans don't have track lengths printed on them, but the enterprising user who entered the track listing on VGMdb indicated that the track was 0:59 in length. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure that's probably the whole track. &lt;a href="http://nippori-friedrice.com/anime/review/Hellsing_2.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Some random Japanese reviewer&lt;/a&gt; also lists it as 0:59, for independent corroboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There's an amusing annotation beneath the track list on the poster that basically says "Per the intent of the composer, this recording includes noise and unexpected sounds". I suppose, then, that an unexpected &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of sound is not too far beyond the pale.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="2964" Title="How did Itachi awaken his Mangekyou Sharingan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;If Itachi didn't kill Shisui, how did he really awaken his Mangekyou Sharingan?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2965">&lt;p&gt;The Mangekyou Sharingan is activated once its user experiences great loss, especially of someone close to him.&lt;br&gt;
This means that Itachi did not have to kill Shisui in order for the Mangekyou to activate. What is most important for the activation is that the user &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; the loss, which causes their brain to release a special kind of chakra that affects their optic nerves (chapter 619), thus awakening the Sharingan, and the Mangekyou, depending on what 'level' you were before, and on how much loss you have experienced. The more loss you experience, the more powerful the Sharingan gets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably, just witnessing Shisui's death to protect the village was traumatic enough for Itachi to awaken his Mangekyou.&lt;br&gt;
Also, if you remember, Sasuke's Mangekyou activated when Itachi &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt;. He did not kill him either, but witnessing his death, even though he hated him, was traumatic enough to activate it.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4082">&lt;p&gt;That may be true, but that's not how Sasuke got his Mangekyou Sharingan. In the episodes following the fight, we learn that Itachi implanted his Mangekyou powers (Amaterasu, etc.) into Sasuke. Those powers activated when Sasuke looked at Madara's Sharingan; as Madara explained, Itachi made the abilities self-activate when they came into contact with Madara's Sharingan. This was because Itachi did not want Madara and Sasuke to meet, in order to prevent Madara from telling Sasuke the truth about Itachi.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="42630" Title="Who can absorb the Genki Dama?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the Dragonball Movie, Super Android 13 Goku absorbs the Genki Dama to become more powerful and defeat his rival. Apparently (not sure), something similar could happen in Dragon Ball Super for a preview from the following episodes which was released. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That leads me to the question, who can absorb the Genki Dama? Is only the creator the Genki Dama who can absorb it? Or can someone else with good ki absorb it too? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've seen in the first Genki Dama Goku made that someone with good spirit like Gohan could bounce the Genki Dama, may be someone with good ki can absorb it too?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="42733">&lt;p&gt;So far there has been no reference to another person who can absorb the Genki Dama other than the creator, which happens accidentally in the latest Dragon Ball Super episode. Hypothetically speaking, I don't think a person with good ki can absorb it, although they aren't harmed, A Genki Dama Bomb is still an attack used to defeat foes who's ki isn't 'good', So it is safe to assume that Goku will only use it against people he knows it'll harm. Having someone with good ki absorb it would most probably make them OP so it is probable that it is introduced later in order to defeat a strong character.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="15321" Title="How does Obito have two Sharingans if Madara took one?" Body="&lt;p&gt;If Madara took Obito's left eye, how come he has both Sharingans? (Chapter 683, page 15) Did Obito replace the one he lost with Kakashi's Sharingan, like a trade?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="15325">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obito had his Right eye Kamui Sharingan and Madaras Rinnegan in his
  left socket. Madara snatched Kakashis Kamui Sharingan and used it to
  enter Kamui Dimension and retrieve his Rinnegan. He was successful and
  Black Zetsu possessed Obitos right body half, which was eyeless until
  Madara popped Kakashis Sharingan in. Obito got both his eyes back in
  that moment, but B Zetsu was using the Obitos right half and used
  Kakashis eye to get himself and Madara out of the dimension..  It was
  mentioned, but it was easyly possible to miss.. I thought for quite a
  while that Obito didn't have both of his eyes until it was cleared up
  to me, that the Obitos right eye was never touched by madara.. thus
  giving him both eyes. Why did Madara pop Kakashis Kamui eye back? I
  don't know... Lets just say for plot, because he could have just
  crushed it. I'd assume he didn't consider Obito a threat anymore and
  wanted the MS Sharingan as backup for whatever reason.. It really
  caused a stir here when those chapters came around&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The "unmentioned" situation you're looking for spans from chapter 674
  to 676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the answer given by that person, you can refer to his post here. &lt;a href="http://forums.mangafox.me/threads/511150-How-did-Obito-get-his-left-eye-back" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://forums.mangafox.me/threads/511150-How-did-Obito-get-his-left-eye-back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="15333">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because Madara gave him the Sharingan he had taken from Kakashi back when he took the Rinnegan Obito had in his left eye socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In chapter 674, page 14, Madara takes Kakashi's Sharingan eye (Obito's left eye):  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qwGI.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qwGIm.png" alt="Naruto chapter 674 page 14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 675, page 10, Madara switches his left eye - currently holding Obito's left eye - for the Rinnegan Obito has in his left eye socket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mp6O.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mp6Om.png" alt="Naruto chapter 675 page 10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same chapter, he lets Black Zetsu take control of Obito's left side. In chapter 676, page 2, we see that Obito now has both of his Sharingan, though he is not in control of his body:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzKwx.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzKwxm.png" alt="Naruto chapter 676 page 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 679, page 6, Black Zetsu leaves Obito's body to join Kaguya:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5GWd.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5GWdm.png" alt="Naruto chapter 679 page 6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving him finally in control of both of his Sharingan when Naruto revives him and he regains consciousness in chapter 683, page 6:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m88Fo.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m88Fom.png" alt="Naruto chapter 683 page 6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Does it have a reference in any Touhou anime, manga or novel?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="25929">&lt;p&gt;It is probably referencing to a Touhou game which will be later adapted into an anime in the series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the openings for "Memories of Phantasm" incorporate scenes from later episodes. For example, the opening of the first episode has scenes which later appeared in the next 3 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxAvG.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxAvG.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was in episode 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 5 openings so far there's lots of sneak previews of what appears to be references to other Touhou games: for example, &lt;a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Subterranean_Animism" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Subterranean Animism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Imperishable_Night" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Imperishable Night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JYxue.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JYxue.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene with Marisa with a measurement devise on her back is almost certainly another reference Subterranean Animism to as the three characters shown - Nitori, Patchouli and Alice - are &lt;a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Subterranean_Animism/Gameplay#Character_Statistics" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Marisa's partner's in the game&lt;/a&gt;. It is also underground which is where Subterranean Animism is set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore in the game, the protagonists are given a device that &lt;a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Yukari_Yakumo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Yukari&lt;/a&gt; made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But others got worried, and wanted them to go down into the Underworld, with a device Yukari Yakumo made so they could talk even underground. &lt;/p&gt;

(no pun intended)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest and undeniable contradiction is Dee going from ghost to normal human.&lt;br&gt;&#10;Does this mean that some sort of change of history caused Dee and Alice to &quot;switch places&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5433">&lt;p&gt;For Alice ai was somehow able to save him before 3-4 disappeared and brought him to the real world and the scene with them at Alice's grave showed Alice's original body which was buried 14 years before the series&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5828">&lt;p&gt;My interpretation was that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This was a world where people frequently get special powers by wishing intensely.  Intense wishes can cause perfect aim with Buzzer Beater, special power to eat normally inedible objects, and even a giant time loop when 17 people wish all at once.  The fact that Dee appeared to be the ghost was probably part of the wish of those 17 people.  They wished for a world that would never be disturbed by reality, and their wish made Dee appear as a ghost outside, because that made their world less likely to be disturbed by reality.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 In this story, God makes rules that are more like loose guidelines, and God breaks His own guidelines frequently.  The gravekeeper Scar wasn't supposed to be able to cry, but apparently she wished to be more normal and  God transformed her - apparently into a normal woman.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 At the end of the story, just before Ai was pushed out of the room, she was wishing with all her heart that she could find some way to save everyone.  I presume God granted her wish by breaking His own rules, as He had done many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5991">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee appeared as a ghost because her physical body was still stuck in class 3-4, while Alice had a physical body outside because he was already buried by a proper gravekeeper. Therefore, his body wasn't in class 3-4 like Dee, and could appear normally since he was part of the world outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee has a physical body later on, because the world class 3-4 created had been destroyed. Her physical body was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ai saved Alice by wishing intensely. In &lt;em&gt;Sunday Without God&lt;/em&gt;, by wishing for something really badly it somehow would be granted, like how Hampnie Hambart wished to die happily besides his family, or how Alice got the ability Buzzer Beater. When Ai wished for Alice to be saved, God granted that wish, and so Alice could have a physical body outside class 3-4's world and continue to live his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49377">&lt;p&gt;The reason for the scene where Ai was in front of Alice's grave with Alice standing beside her...
The original Alice had already died. Then after class 3-4 wished for the incident to never happen (causing a time-loop to occur), Alice's soul was probably revived while his body was buried. Alice of course had no idea he died. So while he kept searching for a way to break the time-loop, he started to change and then he met Ai. Ai probably wished for the Alice she knew to come back to life. Thus the original Alice was still buried and the Alice whom Ai knew revived.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually they make the recipient irked, though sometimes it is considered cute depending on the situation. It comes from the Kansai dialect version of "dou da&#12300;&#12393;&#12358;&#12384;&#12301;", which is "do ya&#12300;&#12393;&#12420;&#12301;", a phrase that translates to "How's that?" So, the literal translation would be a "how's that face".

The "age" part comes from "age-age (&#12450;&#12466;&#12450;&#12466;)", another slang term meaning "in high spirits" or "rockin'".  Basically these terms are used when you're liking something or things are getting exciting. The "poyo" part is an auxiliary suffix that has no meaning. Apparently it was added because it "sounded good".  Note that native Japanese speakers have trouble with understanding this, so I'm not sure if my explanation is 100% accurate. Also, I do believe that the word is dying out since its peak in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The woman whom thou gavest to be with me&lt;/em&gt;: Genesis 3:12. Adam's reference to Eve when he tries to blame her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this be the work of men, it will come to naught&lt;/em&gt;: Acts 5:38, where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel#In_Christian_tradition" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gamaliel&lt;/a&gt; argues against persecuting the Christians, with the reasoning that if the movement is illegitimate (i.e. "the work of men"), it will die out on its own, and that if the movement is in contrast "of God," then it will be successful either way, and its persecutors will have opposed God. The translation &lt;a href="http://haydock1859.tripod.com/id120.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which I have been unable to identify, gives an exact match with the EVA title; translations such as the NRSV or KJV differ a bit from this wording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me go, for the day breaketh&lt;/em&gt;: Genesis 32:27, after Jacob has spent a night wrestling with a man, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel#Interpretations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;generally identified&lt;/a&gt; as an angel, or as God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As one of us, to know good and evil&lt;/em&gt;: Genesis 3:22. Discussed in the text of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come now, let us make covenant, you and I&lt;/em&gt;: Genesis 31:44, where Jacob and his father-in-law, Laban, make a covenant. Jacob earlier left Laban, for whom he had worked many years, and Laban had pursued him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell me, I pray thee, thy name&lt;/em&gt;: Genesis 32:38, where Jacob asks for the name of the man with whom he has been wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives&lt;/em&gt;: Genesis 31:50, in Laban's conversation with Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures&lt;/em&gt;: Job 3:21, where Job speaks after troubles arrive at his door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath&lt;/em&gt;: this exactly matches the KJV translation of Ephesians 6:4, but similar themes appear &lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-21.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun&lt;/em&gt;: Revelation 12:1. I don't really understand the Book of Revelation, but &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Apocalypse" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this woman&lt;/a&gt; appears to be associated with the Virgin Mary or the Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new&lt;/em&gt;: Revelation 21:5. The man upon the throne appears to be Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that aside, I've just finished reading vol. 10, and there seems to be (at least &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;) a slight (if rather superficial) correspondence with the quote used for the volume title and the subject of the volume. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two volumes with titles taken from Genesis 3:12 (which involves a woman) cover Asuka's arrival and interactions with Shinji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vol. 6, per the Wikipedia summary and my bad memory, is when Shinji is forced to fight Toji against his will, after Unit-03 is infected by an angel, which fits a quote about leaving a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We still have to wait. I am optimistic that he would come back, since he is one of the major supporting characters of the series. From &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Yamato" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yamato's wiki page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kabuto escapes to the Mountains' Graveyard where he and Tobi gather information from Yamato about the Allied Shinobi Forces. Kabuto also studies Hashirama's DNA within Yamato to strengthen the White Zetsu Army. Rather than kill Yamato when he has fulfilled his usefulness, they suspend him opposite Hashirama's clone for future use.&lt;p&gt;
  At some point during the war, his body was encased within Tobi, seemingly using Yamato's altered DNA to strengthen its own Wood Release. After Madara Uchiha activated his Infinite Tsukuyomi, Yamato was freed from within Tobi's body in an unconscious state, as he had no further use for Tobi. He was then immediately caught in the genjutsu.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Technically, it's probably like siblings, but it seems more like Mikasa has feelings for Eren that are unrequited.  Or maybe Mikasa feels like she is Eren's servant?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49470">&lt;p&gt;Yes, Mikasa has romantic feelings for Eren. 
In &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 13&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Someone mistook Mikasa as Eren's girlfriend, to which she replies while blushing that 'they're family.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 50&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Mikasa was thanking Eren, she was blushing and putting her face close to his face. They were in a hopeless situation, about to die. She might have seen this as an opportunity to express her feelings to Eren. When she put her face close to his, it looks like she was about to kiss him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blushing/causes/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, blushing can be caused by strong emotions. Seeing as how Eren saved her before and been there for her, it's no surprise that she would develop feelings for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 70&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;look at Mikasa's face when Eren complimented Historia, who blushes and looks embarrassed. If that's not a look of jealousy, then I don't know what else it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example that comes to mind is &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; (&#12506;&#12523;&#12477;&#12490; &lt;em&gt;Perusona&lt;/em&gt;), which, when translated to English, ended up with the pun "Bear-sona!" said by the character Teddie (yes, like teddy bear), whose original Japanese name was Kuma (literally "bear" in Japanese), clearly not having such a pun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another rather complex example is &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3474/274"&gt;this tongue twister&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very complex pun in both Japanese and English, using completely different bodies of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studios which produced &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensai_Bakabon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tensai Bakabon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Movie_Shinsha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;TMS Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Pierrot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Pierrot&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are rooted in Japan and produced the anime in Japanese. The original manga was written by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujio_Akatsuka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Fujio Akatsuka&lt;/a&gt; (a native Japanese) and published in various Japanese &lt;em&gt;shounen&lt;/em&gt; magazines by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodansha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kodansha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogakukan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Shogakukan&lt;/a&gt;, both Japanese publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8565">&lt;p&gt;Just like Eric above has said it's not uncommon in anime, so is in the manga world. The translator 'localized' the joke. Well 'localized' is just a word I choose though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my country whose language ain't English, many mangas from Japan are published, but as far as I remember, I can't remember a joke appeared in Japanese. Once I read Miiko (I forget it was in &lt;a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=10206" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kocchi Muite! Miiko&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=4014" rel="nofollow"&gt;Miiko Desu!&lt;/a&gt;). The setting was in the bus, where one character named Mari have a car sickness. Then, Miiko engaged her classmates to play a chain-word game (where someone says a word and next person has to said a word started with the same last alphabet as the previous word spoken) so that Mari would forget her sickness. Too bad though, accidentally, the words their classmate said all had relation to the sickness, like food's name (imagine you're queasy and have to be reminded of food), even one clearly said "puke" XD. Miiko manga is from Japan, so were the words I read in the chain-word game in Japanese? Nope. They're in my native language. But the translator did a very good job in choosing the words, so the story ain't disturbed even a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another side is from manga scanlation world. Many scanlations have something like "TL's note" (Translator's note). There, I often (not that often though) see translator told how hard it is to translate the joke, since it's a wordplay like the tongue twister Eric gave as example. Some tried to 'localized' it, some left it as it is, wrote the literal meaning, and later gave explanation about the joke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't read Bakabon, but yeah comedy/gag manga usually will have many words-play like that. I don't really know since I'm not a translator either, but translating joke must be very tough, because you have to keep the meaning intact, while keeping the joke itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, Bakabon IS originally in Japanese, and all the puns you've seen is originally in Japanese. IMHO, with Bakabon you read that made you even questioning the origin of it, sounds its translator did a very good job with 'localizing' the jokes :) We don't know whether the meaning is intact or not, but I think as long as you read it and you don't feel something's lost, well we could say it's very good :)   &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="52679" Title="Who is the strongest esper in One Punch Man?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In One Punch Man there are several espers. One of them claims to be stronger than Tatsumaki. Is this true? Who is the strongest esper in One Punch Man?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="52809">&lt;p&gt;Update: Gyoro Gyoro(Monster who created Orochi, the king of monsters) and described by Tatsumaki as a "Bag of Flesh" was actually as said, a doll controlled by an esper. While that esper goes by the name Psykos, nothing is revealed about her yet in the manga (Much less the anime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoiler from the Webcomics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the Webcomics of One Punch Man (The most original version which is far ahead of the manga) created by the group One, shows the fight between Psykos and Tatsumaki. It is then revealed that Psykos was once a student/part of Fubuki's group and was nearly overpowered by Tatsumaki until the Cadets of the Monster Association attacked Tatsumaki. While defending herself against the Cadets, she didn't realize that Psykos was about to attack her until it was too late. After Tatsumaki was defeated by the surprise attack from Psykos, Fubuki comes in and attacks Psykos, which she comes out of victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we could say that... (Spoilers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fubuki is the strongest because she won against Psykos who defeated the "strongest" esper Tatsumaki, but seeing as Psykos was weakened and Fubuki had focused her training on defense against overwhelming psychic strength, they all were strong in their own ways. Tatsumaki had the overwhelming resistance and raw power to crush enemies, while Psykos and Fubuki used subtle techniques like doll manipulation (Gyoro Gyoro), and scattering the psychic waves respectively. However, as User Gary Andrews 30 pointed out, Tatsumaki was shown to be more powerful in several more instances and Fubuki's simple scattering technique didn't count as power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psykos's character page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Psykos" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Psykos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The following will be spoilers for anime-only people, but at this point the encounter has happened in the manga, and is essentially the same as in the webcomic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Though as mentioned in Sphinx's answer, in the webcomic Psykos, the real identity of Gyoro-Gyoro, tactically outmaneuvers Tatsumaki in a group battle by landing a sneak attack to disable her while she's about to crush several other Dragon rank monsters.  This isn't a victory by esper ability, but one can certainly give her credit for knowing how to find and exploit an opening in Tatsumaki's defenses.  Sphinx's answer is otherwise misleading as regards Fubuki, as in the same chapter her special technique is described it is pointed out that Tatsumaki mastered it as a child and has since adapted it into a weapon. That's the usual story of things: every new height Fubuki reaches is something Tatsumaki has achieved since childhood. Fubuki needed it to deal with Psykos's superior power.  There's no indication that Tatsumaki ever needed anything more than her usual barrier to completely negate that power, though she's certainly aware of how to use that technique to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Did Madara use Izanagi or Izanami and if yes then how did he have two Rinnegans? If someone uses Izanagi their sharingan gets destroyed right? If he used Izanagi then he should have only one sharingan left and then that evolved into Rinnengan. How does he have two Rinnengans?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="37594">&lt;h2&gt;Spoiler alert for if you haven't finished the manga or anime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Madara used the Izanagi to cheat death (just like I said in the comment section). The second part that I said was wrong. When he was fighting Hashirama he bit off a part of his (Hashirama's) arm, then after his "death" he vomited up the piece of flesh and implanted it into his wounds, which let him activate the Rinnegan (in both eyes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should remember that Hashirama is Ashura's reincarnation and Madara is Indra's (Ashura and Indra are The Sage of Six Paths' children), which is the reason why he was able to awaken it (Rinnegan) in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Rinnegan can typically be awakened by gaining Hagoromo's chakra either by reproducing it from combining the chakra of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, or by directly receiving chakra from Hagoromo himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Madara's Sharingan did not become Rinnegan until decades later, at the end of his natural lifespan; this also seemingly &lt;strong&gt;restored the eyesight lost from his use of Izanagi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he didn't awaken the it right away. (The other part of your question is also answered above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Mangeky&#333; Sharingan's usage and activity place a great strain on the user themselves, wearing at the user's body and causing deterioration to their vision until eventually over-usage leaves them blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is case with Izanagi.
Izanagi in same way takes away ordinary mangekyo Sharingan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their vision can be restored by receiving the transplanted Mangeky&#333; of an Uchiha with strong blood ties &#8212; ideally a sibling &#8212; thus awakening so-called&#160;Eternal Mangeky&#333; Sharingan. The Eternal Mangeky&#333; merge the designs of the transplanter and the transplantee's original Mangeky&#333;.
  Their Mangeky&#333;-based abilities are made stronger and they ** no longer suffer any negative side-effects from the usage**. According to&#160;Madara, the Eternal Mangeky&#333; Sharingan is proof an Uchiha continues to seek something despite experiencing great losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Madara had eternal mangekyo Sharingan which he never after Izanagi.
Thus, he could have Rinnegan in both his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39380">&lt;p&gt;He sealed the Izanagi in his eye before the battle meaning that if he died it would activate and bring him back, so in theory he could have used his old Sharingan before he gained the eternal mangekyo, after all we saw Danzo do that having a sharingan in his arm to sacrifice rather than the one he had in his head. So why can't madara have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I watched &lt;em&gt;Otoboku&lt;/em&gt;, but I've always wondered if the visual novel explained what happens to Mizuho after he graduates and puts aside his fa&amp;ccedil;ade. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mizuho is a guy disguised as a girl, attending an all-girls school. He doesn't exactly keep a low profile, either; if he'd done that, he could have just made his girl form disappear after graduation and went back to being a man. Instead, he runs for Elder and becomes a celebrity who is looked up to by the younger girls. When he graduates, he can't just throw off his wig and dress, go &quot;Phew, what a relief&quot;, and be a man again, because tons of his former classmates recognize him. He would have to either tell them all &quot;Yeah, I was cross-dressing all those years and hanging out in the dressing room and bathrooms with you&quot; and get arrested for a pervert, or else pretend to be his own brother (or something) and get out the disguise again whenever his old school friends come around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgOsd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mizuho hair flipping&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes, seriously, that's a guy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, Mariya, Takako, and Shion all know by the end of the anime series that Mizuho is a guy.

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha - ViVid&lt;/em&gt; Vivio's Intelligent Device Sacred Heart, AKA Chris, takes the form of a rabbit in Standby Mode while most other characters go something they can wear (ie. Nanoha's Rasing Heart necklace, Erio's Strada wrist watch, Shamal's Klarwind rings, Fate's Bardiche grove). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23751">&lt;p&gt;The reason why Chris (Sacred Heart) take the form of a rabbit in Standby Mode is most likely because the rabbit form is based off from a present Vivio got when she was young, something very precious to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Episode 13 of &lt;em&gt;StrikerS&lt;/em&gt; when Vivio is being treated after being rescued by the Riot Force 6 Forwards Nanoha buys a white rabbit she saw in the hall and returns to Vivio's room placing it by her pillow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the episode Vivio is seen crying when Nanoha goes to leave to learn of the reason why Riot Force 6 was created. when Fate approaches Vivio to calm her down she picks up Vivio's rabbit, while she talks you'll notice that as Fate moves the rabbit around Vivio's follows it with her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you'll also notice that the 2 look very similar (albeit the glow on the cheeks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Right:&lt;/strong&gt; Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid Poster with Vivio and Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i would suspect the rabbit has the same kind of sentimental value as Nanoha's and Fate's hair ribbons they traded to one another at the very end of the first season, but later on for a grown woman to be carrying a rabbit toy would seem strange&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; so making it her device's Standby Mode preserves it's spot in Vivio's life and thus keeping the memory of Nanoha close to her no matter how far they be apart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1: Vita carrying the rabbit Hayate brought her isn't strange because Vita will &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; look like a child&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the net marginal cost of producing the CDs is high&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes they don't expect to sell very many copies of the dvd in the first place, and they have to sell them at a higher price to cover the overhead.   The more dvds that they produce and sell, the lower the net marginal cost of producing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who do want to buy the dvds will pay that much for them&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the fanbase is strong enough and small enough such that those who will buy the dvds will pay any amount for them, and the number of people who would pay $20 for the dvd, but not $50, is relatively low.  in this case, it makes sense to sell the dvd for $50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

That Shinigami then kills someone for a human, to save his life, and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean the human would gain 500 years to his lifespan?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="65">&lt;p&gt;Essentially yes, they will become semi-immortal. They will have a long, long natural lives but they'll still be vulnerable to death.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13263">&lt;p&gt;The human would indeed gain 500 years to his lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shinigami who die are reduced to dust, and their remaining lifespan is given to the human they saved. &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Shinigami" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very unlikely to see that human live those 500 years though. Shinigami are lazy and don't want to be bothered with the human world too much, so the human would become an eagerly desired target for the other Shinigami. If they would kill that specific human they would be able to gamble for 500 more years without having to be bothered with writing some new names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically he would gain a lot of extra lifespan, but it wouldn't make him immune to the power of the Death Note. &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/11424/6166"&gt;An example of this was seen with Misa Amane&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having gained the lifespan of two Shinigami, she still only lived a couple of years after their deaths, because the Death Note had recalculated her lifespan over several occasions during the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned by &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/27/madara-uchiha"&gt;Madara Uchiha&lt;/a&gt;, humans with a lifespan of 124 years or higher can indeed not be killed directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You cannot kill humans at the age of 124 or over with the Death Note.
  &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note#How_to_Use:_XXIX" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;XXIX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could be killed indirectly by killing people that would result in his lifespan being recalculated, but as I mentioned Shinigami are lazy, so they wouldn't bother to do so intentionally, making him indeed semi-immortal :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fine if you didn't understand the first episode. Things will gradually be explained in the anime, though not in much depth as in the manga, but you will start understanding the story. Just hang on to it for a while...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't wait that long and insist on knowing the back story (which will probably be explained in the anime later), then go on and read the spoilers below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ending of Season 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; There was a battle between Kaneki and Arima in the end of Season 2. Kaneki was seriously wounded (Arima pierced his brain through the back of the skull, destroyed his left eye and then finished the fight with the stab through the other eye). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story of Haise Sasaki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Kaneki survives and becomes a prisoner at Cochlea (3rd floor), but becomes amnesiac (experiences total or sometimes partial loss of memories). Arima started bringing him books in the prison and his health improved substantially. Since he lost his memories, Arima gave him a new name using his (formerly Ken Kaneki)'s two favorite kanji from the words "coffee" and "world" - Haise (&lt;strong&gt;Haise Sasaki&lt;/strong&gt; as the one in the anime currently being aired). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Quinx Squad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The CCG then decides for Haise (formerly Ken Kaneki) to be the mentor and overseer of the &lt;strong&gt;Quinx squad&lt;/strong&gt; under the supervision of Arima. The Quinx members are referred to as humans with built-in quinque in their bodies, drawing a distinction between them and normal one-eyed ghouls. The members are regarded as human research subjects who have undergone the surgical procedure developed by Dr. Kouitsu Chigyou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, the current Quinx squad (Kuki Urie, Saiko Yonebayashi, Tooru Mutsuki and Ginshi Shirazu) under the mentorship of Haise Sasaki as seen in episode 1 of season 3.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep in mind that these are translations and he might have said it differently in Japanese. Have fun reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His most recent one liner on Dressrosa is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20202/6166"&gt;Over the 9 mountains and 8 seas... Throughout the world itself... There is nothing I cannot cut.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote you were looking for when fighting Monet is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You've underestimated me, snow woman. When you thought you couldn't beat me, you should have run. Of course, there are things that I don't wanna cut. But... let me ask you something. Have you ever seen a fierce animal you were sure would never bite? Because I haven't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find 29 quotes on &lt;a href="http://www.less-real.com/quotes/search/Roronoa%20Zoro" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;less-real&lt;/a&gt;. They don't say when he said them though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I die here, then I'm a man that could only make it this far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to accept the fact that you're not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring on the hardship. It's preferred in a path of carnage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Either in belief or doubt, if I lean to one of these sides, my reaction time will be dulled if my heart thinks the opposite of what I choose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don't care what the society says. I've regretted doing anything. I will survive and do what I want to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to kill me? You couldn't even kill my boredom!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You sure can talk the talk, but you're not quite ready to walk the walk. Time's up, it's my turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, are you stupid enough to fall for such a stupid trap that such stupid people set up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I'm a pirate hunter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wound that'd make an ordinary man unconscious... I won't lose to it. A wound that would kill an ordinary person... I won't lose to it! To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes... I can't allow myself to be ordinary!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There should be a limit to how similar a couple looks like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you kill yourself, I'll kill you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Well, how about this. My "luck" versus this thing's "curse". Wanna see what's stronger..? If I lose, then I'm just that much of a man anyways...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is someone that I must meet again. And until that day...not even Death itself can take my life away!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don't know. I'm not sure why myself. But if I were to take even one step back, I believe that all those important oaths, promises and many other deals 'til now, will all go to waste and I'll never be able to return before you, ever again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So what if you're a girl.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I can't even protect my captain's dream, then whatever ambition I have is nothing but talk...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you decided to go to the sea, it was your own decision. Whatever happens to you on the sea, it depends on what you've done! Don't blame others!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You'll never understand...your swords will never be as heavy as mine!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you do anything that would cause me to abandon my ambitions... You will end your own life on my sword!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine! I'd rather be a pirate than die here!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am always serious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I do things my own way! So don't give me any lip about it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I'm going to be the world's greatest swordsman! All I have left is my destiny! My name may be infamous...but it's gonna shake the world!!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you die, I'll kill you!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring on the hardship. It's preferred in a path of carnage.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;When the world shoves you around, you've just gotta stand up and shove back. It isn't like you can do anything just by giving excuses. If I die, then I am just a man who can only make it this far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I'll get strong, stronger than she[Kuina] ever was, you hear me! Strong enough that my name reaches up to the heavens! I am going to be the world's greatest swordsman. I promised her... I promised.. I did...&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="52670" Title="Is Garou actually evil?" Body="&lt;p&gt;So, Garou apparently doesn't kill his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later in the manga, he&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; saves a kid from monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And in the webcomic, Saitama says what Garou actually wanted to be is &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; a hero.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is Garou actually supposed to be evil?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="52673">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Garou (&#12460;&#12525;&#12454;, Gar&#333;; Viz: Garo) is a former disciple of Bang, but was kicked out from his dojo for going on a rampage. Because of his fascination of monsters and his hatred of heroes, he is commonly called the Human Monster and the Hero Hunter. Sitch of the Hero Association views him as a grave threat to the organization despite being only a human. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Garou" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;One Punch Man Wikia - Garou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe he's evil but its early to say that because Garou is still a human&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="52674">&lt;p&gt;Well it sort of depends on how you define "evil".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair warning: everything after this point is a spoiler if you haven't already read the Garou arc in the webcomic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garou romanticizes and idealizes "monsters". He sees them as hardworking individualists who pull themselves up by the bootstraps, only to get trodden over by conformist heroic ideologues. As a child he was always disappointed that the monsters invariably lost, no matter how cool, or strong, or hardworking they were. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the people attach themselves to the concept of heroes and become dependent upon their inevitable victory. The people do not work as hard to prevent wars, catastrophes, and monsters in general because they have the safety net of heroes. So, somewhat paradoxically, the efforts of heroes to end suffering and calamities actually ends up making these into a pandemic.  Garou sees this as a pox upon humankind, and sets himself the goal of rectifying it by becoming the ultimate monster who triumphs over all heroes and justice, and forces the world as a whole to achieve unity and peace in their opposition to him.  Everyone, not just the heroes, must be part of the hard work to achieve peace and avert calamities.  A classic "world peace via worldwide fear" solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if that sounds like evil to you&amp;mdash;terrorizing the world in order to unify it against you&amp;mdash;then sure, he's evil by your definition.  In a literary sense he would probably be classed more as an anti-hero: his goals broadly coincide with those of heroes (world peace), but his methods are more like those of villains (brutish and callous). Put another way, he's Machiavellian: the ends justify the means. The point of his existence within the work is more to deconstruct the concept of heroes and challenge its value and goodness to a society, than it is to be "evil". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now one of the major features of Garou's arc is his lack of self-awareness about all of this. He professes to have abandoned all of his humanity and goodness, and that he is a true monster.  But his actual behaviors belie a gentle nature: he constantly goes out of his way to protect children, and while he does severely injure and hospitalize several heroes he doesn't actually end up killing any of them (though possibly some would have if they had not received medical attention quickly). In a way he finds the insistence of other monsters that he must kill things to reek of the sort of conformist ideology he wishes to rebel against, and seems to subconsciously resolve himself to ignore them and do as he pleases.  A wanton killer, be he hero or monster, is a slave to impulse, not a free being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Garou arc, it is Saitama and Bang that end up berating Garou over his good nature, and how all this monster business of his has been misguided and childish. That he wanted attention and praise and to achieve something great; not to be evil and destructive.  Saitama even says that Garou became weaker as he became more monstrous, and was at his greatest power as a human.  So he was also being counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="7647" Title="Why do anime studios and producers discontinue making an anime?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I've seen many series that just get discontinued, even popular ones. I'm talking about manga and light novel adaptations. Even though a lot of the story still remains left, and the first season gets critical acclaim. Some examples are &lt;em&gt;Kaich&#333; wa Maid-sama!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Baka and Test&lt;/em&gt;. Why do so many series stop after season one?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7648">&lt;p&gt;There are tons of reasons for animes to be discontinued. One of the most common ones would be lack of sales. A anime might become pretty popular, and watched a lot. But if the sales do not match, no second season will be made nonetheless due to money issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Popularity ALSO plays a factor. If the first season is not popular enough towards viewers than a second season is just a waste of cash. However, there are SOME anime titles out there who produced a second season countless years after the first season; so hope is not all lost for fans who wishes for a second season (e.g. Inuyasha finished airing in 2004, however it's sequel series Inuyasha: Final Act started in 2009-2010, completing the entire series since the manga ended in 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of sponsors is not uncommon which can lead to huge budget cuts, which sometimes lead to debt which first has to be covered for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that studios use the Japanese sales numbers as reference point for sales, which differ quite a lot from European/American sales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, I'd assume the reason for this is because anime is naturally common in Japan. In the US it's something different, something maybe a little rare, so people can see it as a targeted interest. If you were in Japan and said "I'm a big fan of anime" people would probably not notice, just as if a Japanese person said "I'm a fan of American sitcoms" because it would be such a wide genre that most everyone would find something that they like. Both people would probably end up getting a response like "oh... that's nice.... which ones?" etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it might also just be a issue between the director and the mangaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fruits Baskets case it was originally going to be longer, but the creator of the manga didn't like the director or something (lol I can't remember exactly) and she didn't allow them to continue the anime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other reasons although less common then money issues would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No free time slot for broadcasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of material (but you're talking about ones with story left to tell so count this one out partially)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of studios that want to take the job (happens more often then you think) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8600">&lt;p&gt;Most anime series are produced to promote the source material (manga, light novel, etc.). Thus for the producers its more important if the sales of the source material were boosted by the anime adaption. So even if an anime is quite popular - it should be noted that even quite successful anime only sell between 3000 and less then 10000 (more than that is rare is considered a very successful anime) discs per volume - there is often no point in producing another season if the sales of the source material increased sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="24294" Title="How does Suigintou function without her torso?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Episode 12 of the first season, after Shinku repelled Suigintou's fire attack back at her and her clothes burn off we see her torso is missing. after Shinku finish explaining how Suigintou was unfinished Suigintou's upper half falls to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why it only when her clothes have been burned off does the reality of her floating upper half take effect? what was keeping both halves together as if she did have a torso?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27312">&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few differences between the anime and manga in Rozen Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suigintou's torso is one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the anime, she has no torso connecting her upper and lower halves.
&lt;a href="http://rozenmaiden.wikia.com/wiki/Suigintou" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rozen Maker Wikia&lt;/a&gt; tells that it is shown in the two episedos of &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/1719/Rozen_Maiden:_Ouvert%C3%BCre" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rozen Maiden Ouvert&#252;re&lt;/a&gt; that she was left incomplete and unassembled, not even receiving a Rosa Mystica. Her love for her father makes her able to move her upper body only. She is awarded a Rosa Mystica later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no explanations to how she could move her both halves of her body without the connecting torso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the manga, Suigintou does have her torso. But she is ashamed of it, because it is defective, with cracks that cover most of her back, and through which her wings come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the manga also does not offer an explanation, since the problem itself does not exist there.&lt;/p&gt;

What happened to his stronger form (Six Paths Sage Mode)!? Did he lose it?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18602">&lt;p&gt;The Six Paths Sage Mode is a heightened state of Sage Mode, which drastically empowers the user's abilities to a far greater extent by combining the &lt;strong&gt;Six Paths Sage Chakra&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;chakra of all nine Tailed Beasts&lt;/strong&gt;. Hagaromo takes back his Yang chakra from Naruto, thus taking away the Six Paths Sage Chakra. I think this might have led to Naruto losing the Six Paths Sage Mode. Maybe...&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18624">&lt;p&gt;There is a theory that Naruto still has the potential to use it but he doesn't, since it needs chakra from all nine Tailed Beasts, which he used up in his battle against Sasuke. The sage said that he was a pseudo-Ten Tails and that the Tailed Beasts could all go into him to speak with each other (this was after he took back his yin and yang seals from Naruto and Sasuke). He may have felt there was no need to, since both halves of the Kyuubi are sealed inside him now.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="19474">&lt;p&gt;I believe that he still has access to the Six Paths Sage Mode, due to the fact that he could still enter it during his fight with Sasuke even after the mark on his hand vanished. Plus, even after the battle with Sasuke, it is shown that he was able to dispel the Infinite Tsukiyomi with Sasuke, which requires both the Rinnegan and the power of all Tailed Beasts according to the sage.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20051">&lt;p&gt;Sage mode is all about natural energy and the moon has no nature, so Naruto can't connect with all the Tailed Beasts. That's why he can't go into the Six Paths Sage Mode. Six Paths Sage Mode is a heightened state of Sage Mode. If Naruto can't use Sage Mode on the moon, he also can't use Six Paths Sage Mode because of the absence of nature. He can't collect any natural energy and he  also can't connect to other Tailed Beasts because they all are still on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20280">&lt;p&gt;Even If he doesn't have all the tailed beast he still should have half of the sages chakra but he did lose the are in which the sage gave his chakra. The movie didn't really show Naruto going all out from what I've seen. 
I don't even know if Naruto still have the truth seeking balls. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20516">&lt;p&gt;I would think that how Minato sealed part of Kurama, in which it could repllenish its own energy when its low. I'm guessing that the taled beast within Naruto could do the samething. Seeing as Hagoromo said that Naruto would be the meeting place for all the tailed beast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naruto should have the potential to use six paths sage mode, seeing as Sasuke still has full access of his rinnegan. He could even turn the eye off completly. I remember reading somewhere that in the Last movie Naruto's chakra was turned into a bomb that destroyed half the moon. That could be why he doesn't use that mode. I did see that Naruto could touch Toneri &#332;tsutsuki's truth seeking balls which means he has the other half of Hagoromo's chakra which is the important thing. &lt;/p&gt;

If not, why do the eyes develop differently?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38938">&lt;p&gt;No, the Sharingan users do not experience the full potential of the dojutsu. If that were so, the tomoe system would not be sensible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Wikia article on &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sharingan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When first awakened each Sharingan usually will have only one tomoe (&#24052;), although in Obito Uchiha's case, as well as Itachi and Indra's in the anime, they immediately gained two tomoe in each of their eyes. Through training and continued use the Sharingan will develop a second tomoe and then, upon full maturation, a third. When Hagoromo awakened Sharingan in the anime, he had all three tomoe immediately. &lt;strong&gt;All the Sharingan's abilities are available to the user from its earliest stage, but with greater development comes greater proficiency with those abilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, why different tomoe in each eye?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since not much is being disclosed in the series about this, we could conclude an explanation from the given facts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharingan broadly has two main abilities: the Eye of Insight and the Eye of Hypnotism. The evolution of the tomoe in each eye could mean the mastery of the respective abilities. &lt;/p&gt;

Kisame said that taijutsu fighter like Guy is rare, but he knows two more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who is he talking about?&lt;br&gt;&#10; Episode 250 at 19:25 to 19:43&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41962">&lt;p&gt;Based on a bit of Googling, that line is a mistranslation. The actual intended meaning of Kisame's line is, &lt;a href="https://www.narutoforums.org/posts/36922634/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"Though this is the third time I'm facing you..."&lt;/a&gt; (It literally translates to something like "For me, it's the third time," but the intended meaning is clearer in context.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three times they fight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kisame_Hoshigaki#Search_for_Tsunade" rel="noreferrer"&gt;When Itachi and Kisame show up to first try to kidnap Naruto&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Kisame accompanied Itachi to Konoha to help kidnap Naruto Uzumaki. After the two gained attention due to their unusual clothing, they were stopped by Asuma Sarutobi and Kurenai Y&#363;hi. Asuma and Kurenai found themselves outmatched, but Kakashi arrived to help balance the odds. Asuma was able to distract Kisame while Itachi fought Kakashi. He waited patiently for Itachi's fight to finish, but before Itachi delivered the final blow, Kakashi remembered Jiraiya's warning and recognised the duo as members of Akatsuki from their black cloaks. Itachi changed his mind and ordered Kisame to kidnap Kakashi and kill Asuma and Kurenai. Before he could do so, however, Might Guy showed up and kicked an attacking Kisame in the face. Following Guy's arrival, Itachi ordered Kisame to retreat, not wanting to start a large-scale battle. Kisame seemed quite annoyed with Itachi's idea, as he desperately wanted to fight the Konoha shinobi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kisame_Hoshigaki#Kazekage_Rescue_Mission" rel="noreferrer"&gt;While Akatsuki is extracting Shukaku (the One-Tailed Beast) from Gaara's body&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; While Akatsuki extracted the One-Tailed Shukaku from Gaara's body, they learned that Team Guy was nearing their location. Remembering his last encounter with Guy, Kisame volunteered to keep them occupied while the sealing was completed. Nagato used the Shapeshifting Technique to make a duplicate of Kisame's body that would be remotely controlled by Kisame. The clone located and confronted Team Guy, but was disappointed that Guy didn't remember him. He converts the surrounding desert into a lake to give him a battlefield advantage and attacks Team Guy. After numerous attempts Team Guy made attacking Kisame, Guy managed to separate him from Samehada, leading to the rest of his team launching an assault. Kisame swiftly made water clones to block their attacks and immediately used the Water Prison Technique to imprison them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Guy then attempted to attack Kisame with his own sword but Samehada intervened and returned to its owner. Now that it was a one on one fight, Kisame directed all his attention towards Guy leading him to use his nunchaku. After exchanging blows with each other, Kisame overpowered Guy, launching him to the bottom of the newly formed lake. Seeing that he had the geographical advantage, Kisame repeatedly attacked Guy until he was forced to open the sixth gate. Doing so, Guy forced away the surrounding water and immediately attacked Kisame, sending him flying into the air, giving an opportunity for him to use his Morning Peacock technique to end the fight, resulting in Kisame's clone being killed. Afterwards Kisame voiced his regret to Itachi that their clones only had 30% of their chakra and thus were not as powerful as their actual selves. Ultimately, however, the two accomplished their task of delaying the two teams long enough for the rest of the Akatsuki to extract Shukaku from Gaara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third time, of course, is the scene you're talking about. Kisame pretends to have been defeated by Killer B, and hides inside his sword Samehada (which Killer B takes as his own) to infiltrate the Hidden Cloud Village (Kumogakure), but &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kisame_Hoshigaki#Fourth_Shinobi_World_War:_Countdown" rel="noreferrer"&gt;he is discovered&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; To protect them from Akatsuki, B and Naruto Uzumaki were sent to the island in the Land of Lightning. After B helped Naruto to tame the Nine-Tails, Naruto was able to sense Kisame's hatred within Samehada, despite his and Samehada's identical chakra. Discovered and outnumbered, Kisame took Samehada and tried to escape, but Naruto used the new speed granted to him by the Nine-Tails to stop him. Naruto was so fast, in fact, that his foot got stuck in a wall, allowing Kisame to continue his bid for freedom. As soon as he exited the Falls of Truth he ran into and was attacked by Might Guy, who believed Kisame was his inner self. Although Guy realised Kisame was not his inner self, he still didn't remember him, instead believing him to be a blowfish. Samehada abandoned Kisame and returned to Killer B. Kisame stole some chakra from the both of them to revitalise him after being within Samehada for so long. Aoba Yamashiro tried to neutralise him with Secret Technique: Stone Needles, but this only enabled Kisame to absorb his chakra as well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Kisame then swam away and tried to make it off the island, and when he reached the shoreline, Kisame summoned a shark and gave it a scroll filled with the information he had gathered. Guy tracked him down and, seeing what Kisame was doing, tried to stop the shark. Kisame then used Water Release: A Thousand Feeding Sharks to conceal it and overwhelm Guy. When Guy's Morning Peacock couldn't destroy all of the sharks, he opened the seventh chakra gate, blocking the sharks' route. To get rid of Guy, Kisame used Water Release: Great Shark Bullet Technique, and Guy countered with his Daytime Tiger. Although the Great Shark Bullet grows stronger when used against chakra-based attacks, Daytime Tiger was composed of "youthful" air pressure. It overpowered and defeated Kisame, as well as destroyed all of the remaining sharks. Though defeated, Kisame was annoyed that Guy still could not remember him and tried to continue fighting, but was knocked unconscious by Guy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 After returning to the island, Yamato restrained Kisame to allow Aoba to read his mind in order to gather intelligence on Akatsuki. When Aoba came across memories of Tobi's face and his promises of ending the "world of lies", Kisame bit his own tongue to force himself awake and broke free of his restraints. The Kumo and Konoha-nin tried to subdue him, but Kisame trapped himself with the Water Prison Technique. Before he was completely immobilised, he summoned three sharks and allowed them to devour him. Within his final moments he remembered his first meeting with Itachi and realised that he was not as terrible as he once thought, as he was willing to give his life to protect the cause he believed in and died with a smile on his face. This act of conviction caused Guy to gain new respect for his adversary and vowed to always remember him. He and the others then attempted to read the scroll that Kisame tried so hard to send, but found that it was booby-trapped; they were each caught in a Water Prison with a shark. Another shark took the scroll and swam away with it, which eventually found its way to Zetsu. &lt;/p&gt;

Cathedral was COMPLETELY destroyed in the kagutsu crater incident, therefore the only one in the series that has any resemblance to the powers of the Gray clan, is the Gray King Seigo Ootori. (Tenkei Iwafune) And any sort of information given on Cathedral is little to null on even the Wikipedia, other than the interesting insignia of their clan.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38357">&lt;p&gt;The first season is an introduction to the Silver, Gold, Red, Blue and Colorless clans and only mentions the Green clan.

Yuzu and Mei kissed and did so many perverted acts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Had this been boy-girl kissing scene it might be considered okay and normal enough. Problem is, Yuzu and Mei are both female, thus their kissing scenes are ecchi enough. Taketatsu Ayana (Yuzu's seiyuu) and Tsuda Minami (Mei's seiyuu) would have to make lots of perverted noises for those scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me that High School DxD also has Itou Shizuka (Himejima Akeno's seiyuu) and Hikasa Youko (Ria's Gremory's seiyuu) make lots of similar noises for the recording.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While Itou Shizuka is also well known to be a seiyuu for Eroge, even she was embarrassed when she had to do many perverted noises during recording in front of many other seiyuus (read it somewhere but forget where, will update with link if I can find the said article again). Itou-san went as far as crying to Asakawa Yuu (provider of Megurine Luka vocaloid, also seiyuu for many Eroge) due to the embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that both Itou-san and Asakawa-san used pseudonym for Eroge voicing. This suggest that such a work is not really desirable or at least it definitely is not at the top of desirable jobs to do. You don't have Hanazawa Kana do Eroge voicing now, do you?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, returning to Citrus, Taketatsu Ayana and Tsuda Minami was not a fresh, newly graduated seiyuu. They have worked in the industry for quite a long time and has built name for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does this means that anime with many perverted scenes pays their seiyuu more?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: to make things clear, by ecchi here I mean the perverted noise the seiyuu has to make for the scene, and not the perverted image.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="54148" Title="What kind of eye does Kirara have in Boruto?"

Each episode is a very short horror ghost story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel like many of the stories in this series are too incomplete, as in, lacking any story/development - it almost seems as if the producer is just making up some random nonsensical stuff in an attempt you scare you off.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But maybe the stories presented do have a background story - like a reference to a well-known ghost story or something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of the stories presented do seem to be somewhat self-contained. For instance, the third episode, &quot;Family Rule&quot;, does explain the situation (the adults are offering their own laughter to please an evil spirit), but other stories don't explain what's going on (for instance, the photocopier episode - there's just this ghost haunting a photocopier, but we don't know why, or what for, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are the Yami Shibai horror stories based on something, or are they just made up for this series?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They might be well-known Japanese stories, but I don't know much about japanese culture so I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EGdM3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5159">&lt;p&gt;ANN writes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for summaries on crunchyroll or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; In Chapter 367, Sanji-kun destroys the Den Den Mushi. That's so
  mean!!! The Den Den Mushi didn't do anything wrong! Even a Den Den
  Mushi would cry if that happened to it! It cries when it hurts! It
  cries because its heart hurts even more than its body! So let's
  apologize to it, shall we? P.N. Naoko &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, well, you see... OK, I
  admit, I may have created that impression, but it's okay. On the right
  is a wild Den Den Mushi. It has the ability to communicate with its
  species through radio (thought) waves. Humans attach buttons and
  receivers to them so they can contact specific other Den Den Mushi.
  So, you can destroy the receiver without hurting the Den Den Mushi.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="16701" Title="Why is it that almost every anime I watch is about School kids?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are a few exceptions, but very few. Every anime I watch is about School kids and/or usually takes place in a school. Why is that so? Is it about the general audience, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yeah, also School Clubs. Schools and school clubs. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-anime-series-NOT-about-high-school&quot;&gt;I found this&lt;/a&gt;, I've already seen quite a few of the mentioned. I don't know if recommendations are allowed on this Stack site but I wanted to get your opinion in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="16703">&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious reasons is that it's because of the target audience. The majority of anime titles are aimed at school kids, so there are school kids in it. Of course there are small important distinctions between the sorts of teenagers and young people, but in general they can all be described as school kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books, movies, tv shows and other works of popular art depict the stories of the sorts of people they are aimed at most of the time. Nothing else is as effective at helping the consumers connect with the characters on screen/page. This is marketing 101 in all its glorious action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, school is a unique time in the lives of most people. It's when you get to be emotional, meet with new friends and enemies, join various clubs and do fun stuff, try out new things and have a chance to turn your life around completely. Later on in life it's usually a lot more stable for most, so it's not as rich a setting as a school. You probably wouldn't believe that adults could have any fun adventures or be as irresponsible as kids in their thirties, too.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="16773">&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/16703"&gt;Hakase's answer&lt;/a&gt; is half-correct. I agree that characters are generally chosen so that the target audience can relate to them. However, I disagree that means that they're necessarily the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; age as the target audience. That is to say, people don't necessarily relate best (as a group) to people who are of the same age as them. What people do relate well to are characters who are in a situation that is at least somewhat similar to what they have experienced, but this generally only means that the characters need to be &lt;em&gt;younger than&lt;/em&gt; the target audience, not the same age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this in more depth, we need to know a bit about anime/manga demographics. You may already know this, but I'll write it here for completeness. There are five key demographic groups. The youngest group is called "kodomo", literally meaning "child". The target age range is something like 3-7 years old. It is not typically segregated by gender. The most famous show targeting this group is probably &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Doraemon&lt;/a&gt;, but there are actually a large number of shows aimed at this group. You probably don't watch many of them, though, so I'll ignore it. Next, there are shounen and shoujo, for (respectively) boys and girls. These target school-age children in the range of 8-17 years old or so. Most of the most famous anime are shounen, including &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece" rel="noreferrer"&gt;One Piece&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Naruto&lt;/a&gt;. There are some famous shoujo series like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/a&gt;, but fewer than shounen. Above that, there are the seinen and josei groups, targeting (respectively) men and women in the 18-34 age range. By volume, seinen is probably the largest demographic group, but certainly not by viewership. You can probably find more information here in a number of other questions about the relative sizes of these and what counts as what. All the ages quoted are approximate, but they're at least moderately accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These demographic groups aren't as flexible as you might think. Most anime is pigeonholed into one of them. Children's anime typically airs during the daytime and is sponsored by the station directly. Most of these aim to be at least marginally educational. Shounen and shoujo anime mostly airs during primetime hours or in the mornings, when they aren't at school. The successful ones are able to secure some external sponsorship and rely on this as their primary source of revenue. Adult anime usually airs in late night time slots (or on special anime stations), when broadcast restrictions are lessened and stations are willing to sell out their airtime. These are usually not sponsored in any way, and actually have to buy their airtime. They rely on merchandise sales, including DVDs and increased manga sales, to break even, and hence are forced into targeting consumers with enough money to purchase the expensive DVDs (typically approximately 6000 - 8000 yen for 2 or 3 episodes) and merchandise. While it's possible for a show to air at a different time than this would indicate (e.g. shounen shows airing in late night slots), it is much harder for various reasons, so it's not that common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I'll restrict to the male audiences, which are significantly larger than their female counterparts (and with which I have significantly more experience). Among shounen shows, it's actually rather easy to find examples where school is nowhere to be found or irrelevant. All the famous examples I listed above don't have school settings. On the other hand, many seinen shows are set in schools. My personal feeling is that it's probably more common for seinen shows than shounen to be set in a school. I don't claim to have anything like a representative sample, and it may be that the two rates are actually about equal. But even still, the fact that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; seinen shows are set in schools casts doubt on the theory that the characters are meant to be the same age as the viewers, since very few members of the seinen target audience are still in high school (and none would be in middle school or lower). By my very cursory counting of my own (not at all representative list), of 16 seinen shows I'm watching this season 11 are set at least partially in schools, which is far more than can be explained by the age of the target audience alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I think the driving force here is &lt;em&gt;nostalgia&lt;/em&gt;. Shounen shows generally try to appeal to younger kids desire to be older and more mature (for which they may use physical strength as a proxy). Hence you see a lot of "adult" characters. By contrast, seinen shows aim to appeal to the desire of adults to return to a more carefree and easy-going lifestyle which they experienced when they were younger. Such shows typically present an idealized depiction of school life. It's a school life very few people actually experienced, but it's at least close enough that it serves the purposes of creating a nostalgic setting on top of which the story and characters can be developed. Of course, making the characters younger means they have more room to develop as well, at least if they are realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a second, related reason. It's much easier to appeal to the lowest common denominator than to aim for the middle of the road. Putting the characters in high school is not going to demoralize anyone or make them feel inferior. Most Japanese people go to (and graduate) high school; the graduation rate is approximately 95%, &lt;a href="https://www.aneki.com/oecd_countries_high_school_graduation_rates.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;tied for third place worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. There's little worry that setting an anime in high school will alienate viewers. On the other hand, Japan's college graduation rate is only about 53%; while that's still very high compared to most other countries, anime producers often won't risk alienating 47% of their audience by setting shows in college. Likewise, setting shows in a workplace environment risks alienating &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET" rel="noreferrer"&gt;NEETs&lt;/a&gt; who are, at least stereotypically, often anime fans, as well as people working in very different kinds of jobs. While some series drop this entirely and aim for a completely unfamiliar setting, this is somewhat more common in shounen series that aim to appeal to the viewer's sense of adventure. Incidentally, for much the same reasons, &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2178/why-are-the-shounen-lead-protagonists-usually-shown-to-be-stupid"&gt;shounen protagonists aren't the brightest lot&lt;/a&gt; either. This is absolutely not to say that anime are never set in workplaces or in colleges (see, for instance, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_x_Service" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Servant x Service&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Time_(novel_series)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Golden Time&lt;/a&gt;), but it's far less common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a case study. One of the most successful anime in history is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-On!" rel="noreferrer"&gt;K-On!&lt;/a&gt;, a seinen slice of life series about girls in a high school light music club. The 2009 anime was highly successful and drew a number of readers to the manga, which before that point was relatively unknown. The 2010 sequel concluded the series with four of the five main girls graduating high school and going off to college, while the fifth entered her final year of high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the anime, the manga was basically at the same point. However, as something of a surprise, the manga author did not decide to conclude the manga there. Rather, he decided to continue it with two series. One would focus on the main four girls in college. The other continued the story of the remaining high school student in her last year and promoted two previously minor characters to members of the club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reaction to this was almost altogether negative. Most die-hard fans did not want a continuation in college. On various internet fora, comments were made. Some people said things like "I don't want to read about a bunch of college girls when I didn't graduate college". Others said "there is no way this can continue to be believable, as now that they're in college, they'll have to get boyfriends, and would not have the time to be in a band together". People just didn't want to read about a bunch of college-aged adult women sitting around and eating cakes, even when they were quite happy with it when the girls were just a year younger. The high-school part wasn't plagued with the same level of negative commentary, but it didn't do particularly well on its own, having lost many of the good characters. Readership dropped drastically, and the manga concluded just a year later, the mangaka apparently having decided too that continuing any further wasn't worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm returning to the female demographics because they provide some interesting contrast. At least stereotypically, many shoujo series are romances, set in school. This is perhaps understandable. In fantasy, action/adventure genre shows which are common among shounen series, the unusual setting is a large part of the appeal. However, for a romance show, the appeal is in the characters, and as a result setting it in a familiar place like a school is probably the best option. Indeed, for most viewers in the target audience, the majority of all of their social interactions would take place at school. As a result, many (probably more than for shounen) shoujo series are set in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an interesting thing happens with josei anime. Josei is significantly smaller than any of the other three demographics I've talked about here. It's actually quite difficult for josei shows to be successful. But as a result, josei series are, in many cases, forced to be more experimental. These series often feature adults in the workforce or college students, sometimes in unusual or difficult situations. Josei is known for being particularly drama-based; romance is present, but often just to emphasize the interpersonal conflicts. Some examples of successful josei anime which do this are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny_Drop" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Usagi Drop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_and_Clover" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hachimitsu to Clover&lt;/a&gt;. One can find even more experimental works in manga, though very few make it to anime. Thus, if you want to find some anime that is really broadly different from the mainstream shounen/seinen/shoujo stuff, you can probably find josei works which will appeal to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at the end of the day, yes, school settings are chosen because viewers can relate to them. However, that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because the viewers are expected to be in school themselves, at least not always. Rather, in many cases, it's because the viewers are expected to &lt;em&gt;have been in&lt;/em&gt; schools at some point, and hence can relate. There are few options as broadly applicable as primary/secondary education for that purpose. Such settings also often are chosen to invoke some nostalgic feelings, and because they won't alienate most viewers. While one can find anime which are not set in schools, they're necessarily more experimental as such settings are not as well developed and appeal to smaller viewerships. If course most anime is not meant to be experimental, and even most experimental shows don't experiment with everything, so the majority of shows nowadays are set in schools, but there are exceptions if you look for them.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of Naruto, the Kazekage wears blue clothing:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XZPEX.png&quot; alt=&quot;Third Kazekage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Gaara becomes Kazekage, the color changes to green:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5yMS.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gaara&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this ever explained, either by the show or by one of the creators?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3057">&lt;p&gt;As of episode 305 of &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt;, this does not appear to have any official word, either by the creators or in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that, for some reason, the garb was initially portrayed as blue in the anime. However, the official cover of volume 49 of the manga portrays it as green (the &lt;em&gt;Kazekage&lt;/em&gt; is in the top left here, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvJY2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;em&gt;Mizukage&lt;/em&gt; should be the one who has the blue garb; this appears to be an error in the anime. However, as you noticed, it was corrected in &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; episode 199 and forward.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kazekage?oldid=750780#Trivia" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; Wiki]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42934">&lt;p&gt;This is probably because Mei (the Mizukage) has the blue hat (water is most commonly associated with the color blue), so they changed Gaara's hat to green (2 blue hats would've looked weird...)&lt;/p&gt;

Even though Urashiki can steal chakra in order to access certain  &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Urashiki_%C5%8Ctsutsuki#Ninjutsu" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;user's abilities&lt;/a&gt;, this does not apply to Kekkai Genkai. As defined by the Wikia, a Kekkai Genkai is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;an anomaly of the DNA that allows the wielder to use unique techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urashiki's ability seems to be similar to the Sharingan in the sense that it can copy other techniques but a requirement needed to perform abilities unique to Kekkai Genkai is that &lt;em&gt;there must be anomalies in your DNA related to the Kekkai Genkai you are trying to copy&lt;/em&gt;. What I think would happen if he tries to copy other Kekkai Genkai (for example, Ice Release) is that he would probably have access to the theory behind performing the technique he is trying to copy but since there are no DNA anomalies in him that enables him to mix both Wind and Water, he would be unable to perform said technique that is unique to Ice Release users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Naruto manga, examples of ways to access or transfer Kekkai Genkai is by transplanting body parts, like in the case of &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/D%C5%8Djutsu" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dojutsu&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Madara_Uchiha#Nature_Transformation" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Madara transplanting Hashirama's DNA to access Wood Release&lt;/a&gt;, or indirectly through Orochimaru's Edo Tensei. This means that &lt;em&gt;you need to have access to the DNA that allows someone to manipulate chakra like no one else can&lt;/em&gt;. Despite this, success rate of acquiring Kekkai Genkai abilities is still low, like in the case of Yamato. It is the DNA that enables someone to be use Kekkai Genkai and not through practice or training to become one (I remember this was discussed when Naruto was training with Kakashi and Yamato).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to accessing Kekkai Genkai via chakra is with the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Rinha_Clan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Rinha Clan&lt;/a&gt;'s Kekkai Genkai, which steals chakra and enables them to &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit_Reflection_Technique" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;create perfect copies of someone&lt;/a&gt; which can use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;any weapons, techniques, and bloodline techniques that the original shinobi have. But this clan has only ever appeared in-game and not in the manga, anime or movies.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="13392" Title="When did Uchiha Madara actually bite Hashirama Senju?" Body="&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13345/when-exactly-did-madara-came-alive-after-his-defeat-against-hashirama&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;, I realized that the time Madara acquired Izanagi, was the same time he got the DNA of Senju Clan from Hashirama. However, after an extensive review on their fight (Episode 626), I can't see where and when Madara bit Hashirama. It said in the wiki that:  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;...To use Izanagi to its full potential, users must also have the genetic traits of the Senju, who are also descended from the Sage..&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question is when and where did Madara bite Hashirama?&#10;How come Madara activated Izanagi (I assume on its full potential) just right after he acquired the flesh/blood from Senju?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13394">&lt;p&gt;I haven't been keeping up with the anime (too many fillers...), so I don't know whether this manga chapter has been covered or not, or if you are even close to it. This was actually shown in one of the manga chapters quite recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't mind spoilers, here are links to a few pages from Naruto Chapter 681:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v45X8.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Madara bites Hashirama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iITKE.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Madara uses Hashirama meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Izanagi#Trivia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Narutopedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past, Uchiha clan members used this technique during an important battle that they had to win at all costs. However, they soon started to abuse the abilities granted by this technique and as such Izanami was created as a way to punish the abusers of Izanagi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am guessing that the Uchiha must have performed some experiments. Maybe as long as you have the both trait in body you can use Izanagi immediately, and Madara was aware of this. Since Madara clearly must have bit onto the meat, he must have swallowed some blood, thus having the Senju trait in his body. This is an assumption, though.   &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13427">&lt;p&gt;First of all, Izanagi has nothing to do with Senju powers. The requirement for Izanagi is that you must be ready to sacrifice one sharingan. If you have more than one, then you can cast it for as much as you have, which is the case with Danzo. The power that is awaken by having both Senju and Uchiha power is Rinnegan. Senju power however, can be used to extend the duration of Izanagi, which is once again, is the case with Danzo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to the main question, Uchiha Madara bite Senju Hashirama during their fight at the Valley of the End where it was believed Madara was killed by Hashirama. It was actually Madara's Izanagi. Later, when he was nearing his death, Madara awakens his Rinnegan. (Naruto Chapter 681)&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;This question may not have a current answer but I want to be sure that I am not missing critical detail. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In chapter 129 of Kuroshitsuji on page 13 there is an eerie message etched into a wall that reads,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Who stole the candy from my tummy?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is attached below with appropriate spoiler tags for anyone who hasn't read it yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further in the chapter it is foreshadowed that Ciel has had some interaction with the persons who attacked the manor.

Or should I just wait for the future chapters? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Awe5el.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snip of eerie image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40471">&lt;p&gt;The twin of ciel was stabbed in the "tummy" maybe the candy is the power of sebastian. In the previous chapter soma said to the agressor "do you feel sick again" wich mean that he look exactly the same as ciel. And in the "circus arc-atlantis arc" when they return in the past of ciel and sebastian when ciel say "i'm ciel phantomhive" sebastian answer by something like "i'm the only one who don't lie..." well all of this is just suposition ^^'&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40518">&lt;p&gt;To be honest I'm kind of getting a weird vibe that it perhaps could be the girl at the End of the Circus arc in which she see the manor burning down to the ground. It is true that at the end of the manga for that arc it show that the girl has Died and moved on to the next Life. However, we never see her truly Die if you know what I mean, perhaps seeing her old child self is a symbol in which that perhaps should could still be Alive however her old self was long gone and Dead and left to be with the gang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I might be wrong in this but it's just a theory&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40617">&lt;p&gt;I'm almost positive it's Ciel's lost twin that has been revived. Maybe it's some inside joke from when they were younger? Sebastian has no idea what it means but Ciel's horror is evident. If his name even is Ciel....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly suggest people research the Twin-Ciel theory. It explains a lot in the manga. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40703">&lt;p&gt;it could be lizzy as well, and candy in the tummy some kind of childhood joke between two. She was told to be proficient with swords and soma kinda was familiar with her, and he was the one who happily greeted the stranger who came. Both of them had short stature. and Lizzy's disappearance still must have some special reason&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40764">&lt;p&gt;This is most likely "Ciel's" twin. In the latest chapter, after Agni dies, Soma punches "Ciel". This is not the only evidence, but this most likely proves the Double Ciel Theory is in fact true. I had this idea about how Sebastian addresses "Ciel". I think he had never called "Ciel" Ciel because if he called him that, he would be lying. Or, it could just be a sign of respect but.....Anyway, I really love this series and I wonder what will happen in the following chapters.
                                                   -Screwaloistrancy:) &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40819">&lt;p&gt;My theory, The candy is the phantomhive ring, which the real ciel swallowed to protect it when they were abducted. Somewhere in the chapter where sebastian was cut up by grell's death scythe and the cinematic record was shown, in the background one speech bubble says "should i be the one to take the ring out?" So, it means that the 'candy' he was referring to was the ring in which the current ciel took in his tummy&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40867">&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I think it could be Ciel's dad. Undertaker hinted at him being alive and it would make sense if it is him. He looks like Ciel, and could possibly be linked to the reason Lizzy doesn't want to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40911">&lt;p&gt;I agree with the last theory of be Vincent, Undertaker's crying and telling the Earl is still with us. There is more, Agni and his murderer both were crouched while clashing, the Murderer is clearly taller than Ciel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it's perfectly is plausible is be Vincent.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="13285" Title="How far can the sharingan go?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The Sharingan makes the user able to follow the target better, which shortens the reaction time of the user. Does the Sharingan make your mind think faster as well?&lt;br&gt;&#10;If it doesn't, the users mind should not be able to keep up with what the Sharingan is able to see. If the mind becomes faster, then the user would become a super genius.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or is there simply no logic at all?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Naruto has recently learned the flash ability from his father Minato. When someone uses flash are they teleporting or just moving really fast?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, could any form of the Sharingan &quot;keep up&quot; visually with the &quot;flash ability&quot; of either Naruto or Minato?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13286">&lt;p&gt;When Naruto learns the Flash ability just before he goes out to join the war, we see Naruto actually getting his foot stuck in some stone after failing at using the Flash ability. From this, we can tell that the Flash ability allows the user to move very fast, because it'd take a large amount of force for Naruto to hit the stone, crack it and get stuck in it. Where as based on concept, teleportation would not exert any sort of outward force, Naruto would shift positions in space, but his initial vectors would not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moment is at 9min 39sec of episode 250 of Naruto Shippudan. Here Naruto get's stuck after hitting Kisame(Akatsuki Member) and Bee chases after Kisame as he tries to get away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, the Sharingan further awakens based on the level of despair a user of the Sharingan goes through. Check the wiki for more info: &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Sharingan's power, because of its ties to the Curse of Hatred, is both a blessing and a curse. The moment that an Uchiha comes to know a powerful emotion towards someone, such as love and friendship, a stressful or emotional condition brought out from losing that precious person causes the brain to release a special form of chakra that affects the optic nerves while transforming the eyes into Sharingan.[26] After its initial activation, the Sharingan may be used freely, although it is possible for an Uchiha to lose memory of such an event and not reactivate it until through willpower years later.[27][28] When the Sharingan is first activated by a user, it has a different number of tomoe (&#24052;) around the central pupil, varying between users.[29][27]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The wielder of the Sharingan, through continued use and training, changes its form further, which involves the eye maturing fully until it has three tomoe. As the Sharingan develops, the user gains heightened abilities through the heightened ocular sense. For example, they can at least copy hand movements with one tomoe, predict a person's movement and copy techniques with two and completely use the Sharingan's abilities when it is fully matured. From what characters have noted, this d&#333;jutsu apparently "glows" in the dark.[30][31] True to its name, the Sharingan and its derived forms have shown the ability to spin.[32] It is shown that when a person awakens their Mangeky&#333; Sharingan without a fully matured Sharingan, their Sharingan will automatically mature while developing into a Mangeky&#333; Sharingan.[33]&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="13293">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Thunder_God_Technique" rel="nofollow"&gt;Flash ability&lt;/a&gt; is a teleportation. It's a space time technique something like Kamui. Naruto hasn't learned it so far. Naruto's speed,strength,skills are dramatically increased when he's in &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nine-Tails_Chakra_Mode" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nine Tails Chakra Mode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now his abilities are even increased with Sage's power.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13295">&lt;p&gt;Sharingan by no means makes the bearer any smarter. Sharingan enables its bearer to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See chakra of someone, but not the chakra points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See motions in greater detail making it feels like slow-motioned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform genjutsu better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do sharingan specific jutsu, like Amaterasu, Izanagi, Izanami, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic behind it is that normally humans don't use the maximal capacity of their brain, only about 10% if I'm not mistaken. In using the 2nd ability, Sharingan utilize more of the brain to do image processing, but not anything else. As for ability 1, 3 and 4, it's just that Sharingan is like a prerequisite to do so, just like a mere 160 cm basketball player would not be able to do slam dunk unless he have an ultra strong foot muscles. Sharingan is like that, only instead of foot, it's the eyes. Therefore, though Sharingan enables such feats I mentioned above, it doesn't make the user any smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Naruto, as far as I know, Naruto is just moving very fast. His fast movement is different than that of Minato. Minato uses Space and Time Jutsu. That means Minato is not moving, he is teleporting. That's why he needs his kunai as marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharingan would not be able to keep up with it when he's on the teleportation, but when he shows up, it can.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="16741" Title="What does Ikumi mean by &quot;Sand that looks like it's from Koshien&quot;?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime &lt;em&gt;Jinsei&lt;/em&gt; - Episode 2, a boy asks them advice on what to give his friend as a Birthday present that doesn't come off as cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ikumi gives this advice:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2tfN.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sand that looks like it&amp;#39;s from Koshien&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I googled &lt;code&gt;Koshien&lt;/code&gt; and all I was able to figure out was that it's a Baseball stadium built for High School tournaments. Does this mean that Koshien is a very important place in Japan? But even if that is so, why sand?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope someone can explain this to me. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="16742">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshien_Stadium"&gt;Koshien Stadium&lt;/a&gt; is the site of the finals of two national baseball tournaments for high schoolers in Japan (referred to as "Spring Koshien" and "Summer Koshien"). Making it to Koshien means that your team is extremely successful, one of the best in the country. Making it to either of these is a dream for many Japanese high schoolers who play baseball. Players who make it to Koshien often have successful professional careers after high school. In addition the sand from Koshien is literally a sacred object in Shintoism (there is a shrine outside the stadium). Losing teams at Koshien are allowed to take a bag of the sand home as a souvenir, which is to teach them the value of earnest effort even in defeat and supposedly holds life lessons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, for many Japanese high schoolers, Koshien (and anything associated to it, especially the sand) is something of a dream. Baseball is one of the most popular sports in Japan, and these tournaments are famous enough that almost every Japanese person would know them and understand this reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a sports-fan like Ikumi, this seems like a perfect present. The fake Koshien sand is actually quite cheap, but it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; valuable given the history and tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="16743">&lt;p&gt;According to japanvisitor.com, the sand at Koshien Stadium is considered sacred:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the enduring images of any day at Koshien is the winning team bounding over to their cheering section to celebrate while the losers cry bitter tears of defeat, beating the walls and falling to their knees, &lt;strong&gt;digging the sacred Koshien sand to remember their day by&lt;/strong&gt;. As long as there are boys who dream of glory there will always be Koshien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-culture/baseball/baseball-koshien" rel="nofollow"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And according to this &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/2ei0og/game_thread_mie_vs_osaka_toin_august_25_2014/cjzp92x" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reddit Post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sand at Koshien is sacred. I mean that literally; the ballpark is considered sacred ground under the Shinto religion, and there's a shrine outside the ballpark to that effect. Losing teams are allowed to take a bag of the sand home as a souvenir. After the game, look for shots of the losing team emotionally gathering earth up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also baseball represents the best qualities found in Japanese sports like a self-disciplined work ethic, teamwork and resilience. These qualities are also valued not only in sports but in life too. Since Koshien Stadium is host to a couple of nationwide events in baseball, being a member of the team who is on the grounds and plays would be a great honor and if you don't win first place, the sand or dirt would be proof of your time there.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="34194" Title="How does Getsuga mode works?" Body="&lt;p&gt;It is said that in order to release Final Getsuga Tenshou, Ichigo has to be Getsuga himself. But, what does it mean? How this Getsuga mode worked? Is it only Zangetsu exclusive? Is it cancelable and be reused?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34205">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, There are no solid answers yet, just theories. As it currently stands, it seems unlikely that we will ever find out either, as the Manga is only a few chapters from ending, Though it may make a return to defeat the final villain and we may get to learn something about it then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory 1) Ichigo fused with his zanpaktou sword spirit. This one does not make much sense, since the zanpaktou is already a part of its wielders spirit, but his sword did disappear, so it has some merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory 2) It was some kind of Shinigami, Quincy, Hollow, or unique technique to the Kurosaki Family (specifically on his fathers side), a lot like what Uryu did when he fought Miyuri, since both lost their powers after the fact. Though there are several big differences depending on where you place it, we only know that Isshin could supposedly do it as well, but cross species abilities are not explored much outside of Vizards/Arrancars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory 3) The most likely theory as it stands, is simply that Kubo wrote himself into a corner. He made Aizen too strong, So he had to come up with a way to make Ichigo Stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory 4) This one is the newest, but also spoils a lot from the last Arc in the manga, Some very big plot points are revealed about Ichigo spoiled here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Ichigo is in some way partially all 4 of the main races, and as we find out, His quincy part suppressed his Shinigami part, and then somehow used some of its own power and the Hollows power to give him his regular powers that we all knew and loved. Eventually, Ichigo is able to fully access all of his powers, and we see his new regular strength is well beyond Yamamoto's and Aizen's, with his reatsu being visible to the naked eye in just his shikai form. This theory is simply that Ichigo used a technique that forced any limiters to be removed, and accessed his absolute power. Like Uryu again, The removal of the limiters caused damage to his Spiritual power network, and he could no longer produce more Reatsu, so he slowly drained it all away until he was human again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets hope in the next few chapters we find something out, but as it stands, If we don't, we probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34227">&lt;p&gt;To understand how Final Getsuga Tenshou (FGT) works, we need first to understand what happened with Ichigo when he wanted to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ichigo and Isshin was in the Dangai (Precipice World) a tunnel that connects Living World and Soul Society. Isshin stopped Ichigo and noted that the train was not there and that while it usually is a bad thing, it was a good thing for them since because the flow of time is different in the Dangai than that in Real World or Soul Society, it is a good time for him to teach Ichigo the FGT. Isshin then told &lt;strong&gt;Ichigo&lt;/strong&gt; that he &lt;strong&gt;can only attain the technique by asking his Zanpakutou to teach it to him&lt;/strong&gt;. He then told Ichigo to sit crossing his legs and start communicating with his Zanpakutou, which is &lt;strong&gt;similar to&lt;/strong&gt; what &lt;strong&gt;meditation&lt;/strong&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened with Ichigo when he entered his inner world is that he found that all the tall buildings are under water. He was surprised but then Tensa Zangetsu shows up and tell him that he can breathe just fine even under water since its just his inner world. Ichigo asked Tensa Zangetsu to teach him, but Tensa Zangetsu refused. &lt;strong&gt;Hollow Ichigo shows up and then fused with Tensa Zangetsu&lt;/strong&gt; and then fight Ichigo, claiming that if he persist on trying to learn the technique, Hollow Tensa Zangetsu will kill him. They fought, but Ichigo keeps getting beaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Ichigo realized that there is something wrong with the fight. Hollow Tensa Zangetsu could have killed him from the first strike, yet he didn't do it. He then understands how he can &lt;strong&gt;learn the technique&lt;/strong&gt;, that is &lt;strong&gt;by accepting Hollow Tensa Zangetsu's blade&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus he let the blade pierce him. Hollow Tensa Zangetsu then told him that that is the right answer for &lt;strong&gt;Hollow Tensa Zangetsu is Ichigo himself&lt;/strong&gt;. Ichigo then proceeds to fight Aizen using his newfound power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what does all this means? This means that to learn (to use) Final Getsuga Tenshou, Ichigo needs to understand himself and accept it as is. That's why it was said that to use Final Getsuga Tenshou, he needs to be Getsuga itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it works? If we see how he attained it, he &lt;strong&gt;probably&lt;/strong&gt; need to enter a special state of mind, which he can reach by meditation. In &lt;strong&gt;Zen teachings&lt;/strong&gt;, there are some &lt;strong&gt;special states of mind&lt;/strong&gt;, namely, &lt;a href="http://www.roadtoepic.com/the-four-zen-states-of-mind/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoshin, Fudoushin, Mushin, and Zanshin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Mushin&lt;/strong&gt; in sports is often called as &lt;strong&gt;"Zone"&lt;/strong&gt;. If you watched Kuroko no Basuke (The Basketball that Kuroko Plays) you will see that when in the "Zone", all abilities goes up drastically, which in Ichigo's case would be his reiatsu goes up so high that even Aizen no longer able to comprehend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it Zangetsu exclusive? Maybe. That question cannot be answered with exact answer. The only thing that we know is that Isshin knows about the technique, and quite possibly has used it before, and that Ichigo was able to learn it as well. If we go by how Ichigo attained it, then it is very possible that others might be able to learn similar technique although it won't be called Final Getsuga Tenshou since they only ones who has been shown to be able to use Getsuga Tenshou are Isshin and Ichigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it cancel-able and reusable? If we go by what Kise Ryouta did during the match between Kaijo and Seirin in the semi-final of the Winter Competition, then yes, it can be canceled, assuming that FGT works by entering a "Zone", and that it works the same way in Bleach universe. What we know for sure is that Isshin/Tensa Zangetsu (I forgot which one) said that once he used the technique he will lost all his powers. He will turn into a normal person. This means that it is not reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aselia (&#12450;&#12475;&#12522;&#12450; Aseria?) is the name of the world in which Tales of Phantasia takes place. ... as well as the combined world of Sylvarant and Tethe'alla from prequels Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is this cutting that would have died between the gap of &lt;em&gt;Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tales of Phantasia&lt;/em&gt; and thus the tree that Dhaos was looking to get a seed from is the new tree that was born after the events of &lt;em&gt;Tales of Symphonia&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is backed up that in &lt;em&gt;Tales of Phantasia&lt;/em&gt; Martel is Guarding the Tree&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="39280" Title="Does Durarara have NSFW scenes?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know if Durarara!! has NSFW scenes because I am thinking in watch the show in my tv in the living room. It would be very embarrassing if someone enters the room in the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39281">&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you're counting with Durarara x2, but as far as I remember, there's at least on scene less appropriate to see in &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; ( with public, I mean not covered ). It's not anything showing off, but rather some actions between two characters.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39385">&lt;p&gt;Two things we have to straighten out here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's nothing pornographic in this show; it's a show aimed at teenagers and young adults who can deal with the themes, action, and suggestive scenes contained within.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's unfair to say it's "NSFW" when you're in your own living room.  What you do in your living room (within reason, so long as you're an adult) isn't that big of a deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said...if you're worried about the embarrassment of watching this show, it may be best simply not to watch it in the living room.  This isn't to say that there's anything that would make you blush and &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to watch it by yourself, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...there is a dullahan whose head is the &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; subject of camera shots,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...there's a vivisectomy performed during the run of the series (in one episode),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...there's &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; themes of violence, corruption, drugs and murder - without spoiling too much, that's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; one of the characters' reason for being around, and if you thought that wasn't enough,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...the show does get psychologically creepy and sexually suggestive, and these themes aren't exactly hard to miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure that your family or others around you can handle or respect the themes in the show, then do what you can to avoid their discomfort and displeasure and watch in private.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I started to notice it consistently happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, in &lt;em&gt;Durarara!!&lt;/em&gt;, a character communicates through text messages. In the English dub (or, at least the version I watched), these are left untranslated, which is really not good seeing as these are important messages.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the sub, they were translated into English just like everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Other dubs I've noticed that do this are &lt;em&gt;Inu X Boku SS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Steins;Gate&lt;/em&gt;, just off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there some reason for this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14743">&lt;p&gt;Dubbing is expensive; subbing is much cheaper to do.  Anime translation companies usually want to dub because they have no shot at getting it aired on TV outside of Japan if there is no dub, so they usually sell the subbed DVDs etc. for about the same amount of money as the dubbed ones, in order for the sales of the subs to to offset the larger cost of dubbing.  Neither dubbing nor subbing requires editing/adding to the artwork (dubs are an audio track; subs are a separate text file that can be overlaid over the art).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, usually text messages and other text shown in the artwork itself often moves as the "camera" pans; it is not usually static and flat on the screen.  Covering it up would require the company to overlay art that moves: essentially, &lt;strong&gt;to animate over&lt;/strong&gt; the Japanese text with text that can move along with the "camera" panning motion, to avoid scrolling the overlay over the character's fingers, to tilt at the same angle as the cell phone screen is being held at, etc.  In other words, it is a different endeavor than either recording audio or typing up subtitles: one that requires more work which is a different type of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the company has managed to land the series airing on TV in the country they're licensed for release in, the amount of money they expect to make off of it would cause them to be willing to re-animate those text messages.  They would not have a large motivation to add that animating work on top of their dubbing expenses if they do not expect to make a lot of money from the series.  If the text message is read aloud in either the voice of the sender or the voice of the recipient, it does not require the re-animating work for the viewer to understand (assuming the dub script is accurate, which is a whole different can of worms).  Using the dub voice actor they've already hired to orally take care of the viewer getting the gist of the message saves money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to add a subtitle track which subtitles only the on-screen text messages, book covers, signage, etc. which would be inexpensive to do.  However, when you compare the dub script with the subtitle script from the same company, there are often differences because the dub is 1) attempting to match animated mouth movements and 2) attempting to sound more colloquial (i.e., "What would this character say if this character were talking naturally in English/Chinese/whatever language is being dubbed?" rather than repeating awkwardly in said language a translated phrase that a Japanese person would say in this situation but which a native speaker of said language would never think to say in this situation) as compared to the sub which is more concerned with 1) fitting in the physical space of 1~2 lines of text on the screen at once and 2) just translating more simply (what the character said).  So when the dub and sub scripts do not match, it would cause more confusion to add that sub script they already made into the dub copy, because then the dub actor's voice reading the Japanese text message and the sub at the bottom of the screen would not match.  It is likely that the company doesn't want to make a separate subtitle file for the dub copy unless it is necessary, again to save on costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sakaguchi was a novelist, essayist, and critic who lived from 1906-1955. He gained immense popularity in the immediate post-war period with his 1946 essay &lt;em&gt;On Decadence&lt;/em&gt;, which criticized pre-war Japan as too heavily steeped in &lt;em&gt;bushido&lt;/em&gt; culture, and argued that though post-war Japan was decadent, it was better than what came before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Decadence&lt;/em&gt; is not mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Kotenbu&lt;/em&gt; series of novels on which &lt;em&gt;Hyouka&lt;/em&gt; is based.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this true and if so why doesn't the humans try to colonize underground?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18373">&lt;p&gt;The main weakness is the back part on the neck that what I want to say. Underground is not exactly weakness. How I want to compare is &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/45627/Levi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Levi&lt;/a&gt; fighting with Titan on plain ground without tree and building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why lead Titan to forest or underground ? Because they loose their power. No The main reason is full utilization of 3D maneuver gear. They are confined and they can't use their full potential and give benefit to Scouting Legion to use their 3D maneuver gear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/13885/6345"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; and all the &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13880/how-would-annies-going-underground-prove-anything#comment17752_13883"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; you would get the knowledge why Annie refused to go underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the case of sunlight I can't confirm that sunlight give extra power or not but night means less visibility which apply for both human and titan. In &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 38 Castle Utgard&lt;/strong&gt; there is night scene and Titan attack castle at night. But in &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 34 Warriors Dance&lt;/strong&gt; face of Titan inside wall is covered so that daylight won't reach the titan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for underground colonization, it is bad idea the reason is as &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/18360/are-titans-other-weakness-the-underground#comment23384_18360"&gt;&#12461;&#12523;&#12450; says in the comment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Would you want to live underground when a group of Titans could walk overhead and demolish your entire city with one jump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="19232">&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence to suggest that being underground/confined spaces can actually be a weakness for Titans. However there isn't any evidence supporting the contrary as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A definite &lt;strong&gt;strategic disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt; of underground transformation is obvious (due to the restricted space for movement and the lack of visibility).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in the corresponding chapter, you would do well to &lt;strong&gt;notice&lt;/strong&gt; that the Titan smashes the tunnel from outside, all too easily. So underground colonization is a definite &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also no hard evidence on whether sunlight is a primary source of power for Titans. If that were the case, then Annie's transformation in the forest would have degenerated (no/minimal sunlight there). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also (as suggested by &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/18373/11643"&gt;@mirroroftruth&lt;/a&gt;), the use of forests is mainly because of the better 3D maneuver environment. However from my perception, undergrounds are just as &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; an environment for 3D maneuvers, as they &lt;strong&gt;may be&lt;/strong&gt; for Titans.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34270">&lt;p&gt;I think the titans choose not to move around at night because if you read attack on titan before the fall recent chapters you'll see how when kuklo went to test the prototype for the 3-D maneuver gear he was still attacked by 3 titans they probably can only see when they're right on you but I think in the dark they can actually rely on smell and hearing which is how they attacked kuklo &lt;/p&gt;

Sorry it&#8217;s been almost 2 years since you posted your question, but I will answer all your doubts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime took the art style from the second manga adaptation when telling the story of the novels. The anime character designs belong to Shingo Ogiso as well.
The story itself was quickly taken directly from the novels as the only source as the anime caught up with the manga. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 19 chapters published when the anime started running (5th April) and also when it ended (27th September). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bookstore.yahoo.co.jp/shoshi-417773/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://bookstore.yahoo.co.jp/shoshi-417773/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bookstore.yahoo.co.jp/shoshi-522005/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://bookstore.yahoo.co.jp/shoshi-522005/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first link corresponds to volume 3, which includes chapters 11-19 and was published in Japan on February 9, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second link corresponds to volume 4, which includes chapters 20-27 and was released in Japan on October 9, 2015. It is important to note that the anime had already ended before this date though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so that you know, episode 9 from the anime covers up to chapter 19 from the manga, and episode 10 covers up to chapter 23. So it would be something like that more or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that point, episodes 10-25 from season 1 as well as all episodes from season 2 could not take the manga&#8217;s adaptation into account while adapting the novels as there was no manga to begin with.
The manga&#8217;s pace is incredibly slow. Even now, 2018, it still hasn&#8217;t started dealing with what season 2 covered (the latest manga Chapter 57 is adapting the last part from novel 3, whereas the anime&#8217;s season 1 covers novels 1- 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ll explain this later in more detail, but the manga&#8217;s adaptation is faithful and respectful to the novel source material. The anime&#8217;s adaptation not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the manga and the novels is minimal. The manga adapts the novels in a consistent and faithful way. The anime, however, is less faithful. Yet again, I&#8217;ll explain this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these are the 2 issues that the OP has. I&#8217;ll explain all of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How much of the manga did it cover?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Are there any differences between the manga and the anime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those questions are answered in these points. I'm adding a few more details for context as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. What should I read?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arslan Senki is a Japanese novel series written by Yoshiki Tanaka. There are sixteen novels written between 1986 and 2017. A manga adaptation by Chisato Nakamura started running in 1990 and finished running in 1996. It had an original ending as it caught up with the novels. Because of its popularity, a second manga adaptation illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa debuted in 2013. An anime adaptation was made in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novels are praised as a masterpiece in Japan, which is the reason they received adaptations in the first place and people kept up with them for 31 years. I would very strongly advise you to read the novels over every Arslan Senki adaptation. 
However, there is no official translation as of now, and not much content has been fan-translated for the past 31 years. So&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know Japanese, I recommend you read the second manga. It is the most faithful adaptation you&#8217;ll find, and it&#8217;s in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Where should I start?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depends on what you want to do and your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-If you&#8217;ve just watched the anime and you want to read the novels (as I said, they&#8217;re regarded as a masterpiece) I would advise you to start from the very beginning. The novels are very long and complicated, so starting from the very first volume is the best option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-If you can&#8217;t read the novels for language reasons and want to read the manga instead, I would advise you to start from chapter 19. The differences between manga and anime increase after chapter 19-20 (end of episode 9) and keep increasing ever since (for example, chapter 29 doesn&#8217;t exist in the anime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-If you&#8217;ve read the manga and want to delve into the novels, you can start where you left off on the manga. Unlike the anime, the manga follows the original material quite faithfully.
To further help you understand the overall situation, I&#8217;m also going to tell you what the current situation is.
2.2 Current situation
The very first season of the anime covers novels 1-4. The anime caught up with the manga when only 3 manga volumes had been published. Those 3 manga volumes cover the first novel.
The second anime season covers the last part of novel 4 (as in the novel, Andragoras's escape from the dungeon is written before the funeral in St. Emmanuel) as well as novels 5 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manga currently has 57 chapters and is now in the middle of novel 3&#8217;s last chapter where Sam reunited with Kubard and convinced him to fight for Hilmes and it is just before Arslan circulated the manifesto all around Pars.
As you can see, the manga has already covered (as of March 2018) half the novels seasons 1 and 2 from anime did. It took almost 5 years though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Would I miss anything if I start where the anime ended?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would most certainly do. The anime starts making more changes from the original novel source material after episode 10 from season 1, so I would suggest you start reading from chapter 19 or 20 (start of episode 10). This is obvious, but when the anime makes changes while adapting the novels, it also deviates from the manga&#8217;s faithful adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Are the manga and anime adaptations faithful to the original source material? Are there any differences between the manga and the anime?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anime: It has added quite a few scenes. Some of them seem to be very important, but don&#8217;t exist in the novels. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Arslan saves Daryun from Arzang, the sorcerer, just before reaching Peshawar Fortress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Bahman gets killed by Hilmes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fight between Daryun and Hilmes at the end of season 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fact that Bodin's men take the sacred sword Ruknabad &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fact that Hilmes gets Ruknabad. In the novels, no one can take the sword except the chosen one who will take over the will of Kay Khosrow, the ancient great King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lack, among others, the following events from the novels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Narsus defeats and kills Arzang. They even skipped Narsus saving Alfarid for the 2nd time, which made Alfarid fall in love with Narsus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Daryun apologizes to Gieve for considering him an untrustworthy person. This event takes place after knowing that Gieve had saved Arslan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Hilmes murders Kishward's very loyal subordinate and Azrael's brother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hilmes valuing Zandeh&#8217;s skill of gathering information by using his men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Bahman accompanies Arslan to Sindhura and fighting bravery as a marzban.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Bahman dies in Sindhura&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Salima, daughter of Mahendra, lets Rajendra arrest Gadhevi, who is Salima's husband.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that a sorcerer tries to steal the secret letter of Bahman and Narsus cuts off his arm. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Andragoras tells the secret of Hilmes's birth to Sam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fact that Daryun captures Etoile before the battle in St. Emmanuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fact that Merlain and Kubard defeat a Lusitanian troop together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fact that Jimsa and Zaravant escape from Andragoras's forces and they start searching Arslan together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The fact that Zandeh throws Ruknabad into a crack in the ground, and pursuades Hilmes to once forget about it at the time when Ruknabad refused Hilmes and made a large earthquake hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;("*" refers to scenes from parts of the story that have yet to be reached in the manga as it&#8217;s still behind the anime)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas in the manga, all the events I remember that were added are just (Note: this list should be quite decent. Unlike the previous 2 ones, here I made a big effort to gather all the differences I remember having noticed when I read the manga):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first chapter (which was also in the anime)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One short fight between Arslan and Kharlan (which was also in the anime). I wouldn&#8217;t really call it a fight, but in the novels Arslan and Kharlan don&#8217;t have that short crossing of blades before Kharlan fights Daryun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Etoile hands a small religious book to Arslan close to a river and the conversation with his companions about it (the anime added the act of giving the Bible, though under different conditions and there was no chat about it between Arslan&#8217;s companions when they go to Hodir&#8217;s castle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sentence &#8220;one in one hundred million&#8221; used by Daryun (I think the anime used it once during the first half of season 1) as well as Arslan&#8217;s famous word &#8220;delicious&#8221; when referring to delicious food (the novels also use that word, but it&#8217;s more frequent in the manga. The anime used the word as well).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farangis usually dresses like a man in the novels, whereas in the manga there&#8217;s fan service. The anime took the manga&#8217;s character designs, so obviously it includes such fan service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Elam has a memory of Narsus praising his cooking skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Kishward already has a wife and a son, whereas in the novels his wife and son appear much later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Daryun reveals Arslan identity to him, Daryun holds his hand. The revelation part is the same, but them holding hands at sunset is new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Montferrart's brother is among Bodin's soldiers who were killed by Hilmes when Lusitanian soldiers were fighting over the sacred flag. In the novels, he wasn&#8217;t present there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jaswant (this character debuts in chapter 43 of the manga) sees Narsus painting, whereas in the novel it&#8217;s not described that she takes a glance at his painting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that the story of how Daryun got hold of his polearm is more detailed in the manga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the latest chapters of the manga (+55), Hilme&#8217;s secret is more explained than in the novels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not much content from the novels has been cut down. Obviously, the novels will have more details, but the important events are told faithfully, and the stuff that gets removed is the kind that is unnecessary and overdetailed for a manga (the manga format is quite different from that of a novel). To name a few examples of the events that the manga didn&#8217;t include while adapting the novels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once Vahriz asks Daryun what his impression of Arslan's features is at Atropatene, there is a line that Daryun says ("He  has a handsome features. I guess young ladies all over the capital city will talk about him in two or three years, but uncle...") right before Vahriz tells him that he was actually asking which one of the prince&#8217;s parents looks more similar to him. That line I quoted is not included in the manga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason why Narsu&#8217;s father died is because he fell down the stairs right before he was about to leave his land and help Andragoras. This led Narsus to go to the capital city and made him famous for the first time as a tactician.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amidst the sorcerers who have served the master sorcerer, Gundhi  frequently appears in the underground room to receive instructions. In case you don&#8217;t remember it, he is the one with an incomplete mask that doesn&#8217;t cover the right side).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that Narsus has been rumored to have love affairs while working at court. Furthermore, Daryun has fallen in love with the princess of Serica. (Just 2 months ago, the author mentioned they are no longer a couple**)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Daryun fights with Bahadul in Sindhura, Daryun gets bitten by a jackal and he chops the jackal's head and even makes its eyes come out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About Pars legends, there exists a deep tradition of not eating sheep brain. Nevertheless, right when Arslan and his friends are in Sindhura, they inadvertently eat it in the food they&#8217;re given. It is stated that Daryun loses his appetite after that, yet Farangis is fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Refers to an event that Tanaka has stated to have happened, but it doesn&#8217;t appear in his novels. He tends to do this sometimes, and his words/messages add new canon material not mentioned in the novels themselves (sometimes these new details/facts said by Tanaka are actually included in the second manga&#8217;s adaptation). This time it was mentioned on 18th January 2018, where we get to know that situation I explained before and exactly how it happens. If you google  31&#24180;&#30446;&#12398;&#12516;&#12471;&#12515;&#12473;&#12451;&#12540;&#12531; you can see it on nico video website, but you need to have an official account and it&#8217;s raw Japanese as no English subtitles exist. In that conference he also mentions unimportant stuff like the fact that he had already decided the ending even before the second half of the novels had started, that while writing dialogues he says them out loud to make sure it doesn&#8217;t sound weird, that Daryun is dressed in black because he was reading the historical and psychological novel The red and the Black&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the manga has more violent scenes that are in the novels but the anime skipped, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that faKishward makes one of Sindhuran&#8217;s soldier swing his boss's head from his neck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The anime changes and skips events a lot, whereas the
  manga sometimes adds an element/detail to the story rather than change it.
  The manga adds very little, and when it does it is unimportant stuff,
  it doesn&#8217;t remove much content and it doesn&#8217;t change things,
  making the manga a good adaptation of the novels. The scenes and even
  dialogues have been following Tanaka&#8217;s original work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="26081" Title="What is the origin of the &quot;this is a work of fiction&quot; explanation? Is it a trope?" Body="&lt;p&gt;At the beginning or end of episodes of anime I sometimes see a disclaimer similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This program is a work of fiction.&#10;Any resemblance to people, parties,&#10;or situations is purely coincidental.&#10;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this a trope? Or is there some Japanese regulation that sometimes applies to these shows?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The above quote was taken from the end of Durarara! ep 1x13 to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26093">&lt;p&gt;This is less of a trope and more of a copyright catch-all claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reference from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_persons_fictitious_disclaimer" rel="nofollow"&gt;All persons fictitious disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, the main reason that this is done is to prevent another person from suing for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation" rel="nofollow"&gt;libel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn't unrealistic to think that someone's family name could be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orihara" rel="nofollow"&gt;Orihara&lt;/a&gt;, and would take grievance with the way Izaya is portrayed.  So, to prevent them from suing, the works are made to be fiction and not based on any one person or any one real event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can also used to cover up for factual inaccuracies as well, per &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha - ViVid&lt;/em&gt; Vivio's Intelligent Device Sacred Heart, AKA Chris, takes the form of a rabbit in Standby Mode while most other characters go something they can wear (ie. Nanoha's Rasing Heart necklace, Erio's Strada wrist watch, Shamal's Klarwind rings, Fate's Bardiche grove). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23751">&lt;p&gt;The reason why Chris (Sacred Heart) take the form of a rabbit in Standby Mode is most likely because the rabbit form is based off from a present Vivio got when she was young, something very precious to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Episode 13 of &lt;em&gt;StrikerS&lt;/em&gt; when Vivio is being treated after being rescued by the Riot Force 6 Forwards Nanoha buys a white rabbit she saw in the hall and returns to Vivio's room placing it by her pillow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the episode Vivio is seen crying when Nanoha goes to leave to learn of the reason why Riot Force 6 was created. when Fate approaches Vivio to calm her down she picks up Vivio's rabbit, while she talks you'll notice that as Fate moves the rabbit around Vivio's follows it with her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you'll also notice that the 2 look very similar (albeit the glow on the cheeks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tqsI8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tqsI8.png" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Right:&lt;/strong&gt; Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid Poster with Vivio and Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i would suspect the rabbit has the same kind of sentimental value as Nanoha's and Fate's hair ribbons they traded to one another at the very end of the first season, but later on for a grown woman to be carrying a rabbit toy would seem strange&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; so making it her device's Standby Mode preserves it's spot in Vivio's life and thus keeping the memory of Nanoha close to her no matter how far they be apart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1: Vita carrying the rabbit Hayate brought her isn't strange because Vita will &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; look like a child&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In FMA: Brotherhood, Alphonse recover the memories he lost after going through the Gate, by having Martel's blood spattered over his own blood seal (the one that binds his soul to his armor), and is, henceworth, able to use the knowledge inherent to it, such as using alchemy without transmutation circles.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there a reason for which &lt;em&gt;blood should have been splattered&lt;/em&gt; over his seal for him to recover his memories?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or was it only coincidence/traumatic?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14902">&lt;p&gt;The blood acted like a charge and amped up the signal of the seal binding him in the armor and his body by the gate this is the only thing that makes since &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27362">&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it's just the blood splatter itself that "jogged his memory" so to speak in a similar way as to how the blood splattered from the transmuted body Al's soul failed to latch onto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually selective amnesia like Al's memory of everything involving the trauma itself can be brought back into one's conscious memories using a trigger which is usually something similar to something happening in the lost memory in the first place (I.e. saying an otherwise insignificant word in the right context that would explicitly be tied to that 1 memory or catching a smell similar to the environment that the event took place)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the trigger that would affect Al and tie his mind only to that incident is the death that HE experienced when his soul had been so violently and near immediately rejected from the body. (Which I'm pretty sure would be the trauma which caused his mind to suppress the whole memory in the first place. Who wouldn't be traumatized by actually dying?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the reason it happened when it splashed on his seal and not say...any other time they might have been fighting and gotten blood on his armor is because he can't feel it. The blood seal is a direct link to his soul, is the only thing grounding him to earth. Since his rejection occurred in a different body he's no longer attached to, it would stand to reason that such a trigger could only be felt directly by his soul or the body he harbors. The blood seal acts as that direct touch to his soul. And this is because blood is ones 'life fluid' and often thought to hold the soul and its direct energy within it (like our unique DNA and Mei's explanation of the dragon's pulse flowing in our bodies). But Al's seal is made with Edward's blood, not his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such the defining reason it even managed to latch onto Al's specific soul and hold it so well and for so long is because their souls were mixed during the transmutation as Ed explains later. In brotherhood this is even easier to see with the brief flashback to Al inside the body they made when it bleeds out rather similarly under an outstretched hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's my take on it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;At the start of Code Geass Japan has just been conquered by Britannia and renamed Area 11. After Prince Clovis's death we are introduced to Princess Cornelia, learning that her Knights had just established another Area for the Empire (I do not remember the number) before leaving to take Clovis's place in Area 11.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am wondering what each of the Areas are (ie. Area 11 is Japan), if they were conquered in the order they are numbered and if they were all also conquered while Charles Zi Britannia was Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="24481">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An Area is a nation or group of nations that has been conquered by
  Britannia and made into a colony. Each Area is designated with a
  number, and its people are referred to by that number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Areas are numbered in order of conquest, though only a handful are mentioned by
  name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United States - Disputed (considering the timeline, the United
States doesn't exist in this world) In addition, Britannians make
several mentions to the "Homeland" suggesting that there's a part of
their empire that isn't an Area. Since the original colonies that
Britannian nobles fled to after losing Great Britain were in North
America, it would make sense that at least part of the United States
as well as possibly part of Canada, would be the "Homeland".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and Queen Elizabeth Islands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mexico&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iceland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hawaii and Midway Atoll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falkland Islands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indochina - Disputed (Indochina is shown as a territory of the
 Chinese Federation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philippines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cambodia - Disputed (While Britannia seems to have connections with
 Cambodia, it was never called an Area) In addition, Cambodia is
 considered a part of Indochina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southern Pacific Islands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Korean Peninsula - Disputed (Shown as a territory of the Chinese
 Federation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indonesia - Disputed (shown as a territory of the Chinese
 Federation, especially taking part of the uprising)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle Eastern Federation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="28310" Title="Were the Arbiters previously humans?" Body="&lt;p&gt;First, I was going to ask where the Arbiters originated from? Like where were they chosen from? But then after watching the anim&#233;, I learned the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Arbiters' 2nd Law : Arbiters have no emotions since they are dummies!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Decim's statement to Chiyuki : If humans stay here for too long, they&#8217;ll turn into dummies!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These two things make me think that the Arbiters might be previously humans turned to dummies and then to Arbiters! Is it possible? Is that true? And if not then what about the origin of the Arbiters? How are they made or chosen?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28312">&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href="http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Arbiters" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikia article on Arbiters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their existence remains a mystery. Nona has stated that they are not human, do not experience emotions like humans do, and have never lived or died. They are even made to look like humans but are created for the specific purpose of judging humans.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it evident that the Arbiters were never humans and shall never be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only exception to the "feeling emotion" bit is &lt;a href="http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Decim" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Decim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JsLPW.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JsLPW.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                        Decim expressing human emotion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, Decim appears to be an exception as Nona has implanted human emotions in him which, though at the beginning did not yet seem to appear or were not yet tapped, appear to be surfacing with him as Chiyuki criticizes him for drawing the darkness of human hearts and passing judgement, stating that it is not right for them to be doing that since humans are more simple than the arbiters think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the origin of the Arbiters is unknown. Since they're said to be "created", we  can only assume that some methods/technology is used for creating them, or maybe &lt;a href="http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Oculus" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; has some power to create them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oculus is the creator of the system of arbitration. He observes all floors and is in a higher position than Nona. He is the second in line to the position of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This is only speculation on my part. There's no mention of it in Death Parade or Death Billiards (Movie), so we can never truly know where they originate from.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I was reading about the characters of Arakawa Under the Bridge, hoping to learn some of their background stories. From there, I found out that the older Tetsujin brother grew younger later in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I took a look to verify and found out that this was true, indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 2,&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BL4UV.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BL4UV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 13,&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/3slJp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/3slJp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did this ever occur in the manga? Is there any explanation to this? Could this be some sort of hint about the show or perhaps just an animation flaw?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28296">&lt;p&gt;From my experience with Arakawa Under the Bridge (and it's been quite a bit of time), the two brothers (along with a number of other characters at Rec's welcoming party) don't get a proper introduction until later on in the first or second seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say it was Shaft making an animation mistake, since the two of them weren't characters they were focusing on yet, so they could draw them without as much attention to detail/quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was something with the manga though; whether the author hadn't made a final decision on their appearances until later on, she just drew them like that for the time being. Shaft, for whatever reason, could've replicated this. (Part of me finds that unlikely because they would've received the characters' heights and such from the manga publishers by the time they started the anime, but part of me think it may be possible because it's Shaft lol.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could look through the manga and see what I could find, but right now, I'd say it was Shaft just making a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="2738" Title="Who is Domo-kun?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Who is Domo-kun? Is he an anime character or a manga character? I often see him in anime stores so I wonder if Domo-kun is an anime character or a manga character? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bgofa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2739">&lt;p&gt;D&#333;mo-kun is the official character or mascot for the Japanese broadcasting channel &lt;em&gt;Nippon H&#333;s&#333; Ky&#333;kai&lt;/em&gt; (NHK). According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domo_%28NHK%29"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, he was created in 1998 and named after a pun on "Hello there!":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Domo-kun first appeared in short stop-motion sketches on 22 December 1998 to mark the 10th anniversary of NHK's satellite broadcasting. The name "Domo" was acquired during the second episode of his show, in which a TV announcer said "d&#333;mo, konnichiwa" (&#12393;&#12358;&#12418;&#12289;&#12371;&#12435;&#12395;&#12385;&#12399;?), which is a greeting that can be translated as "Well, hello there!", but which can also be interpreted as "Hello, Domo", and thus is a convenient pun (dajare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His concept was created by Tsuneo G&#333;da to be a mascot. He appeared only in stop-motion animation originally, so it's hard to classify him as either "anime" or "manga". However, there was a (reportedly terrible) English-only manga of the character, called &lt;em&gt;Domo: The Manga&lt;/em&gt;, published in the USA and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final note, and as you may or may not know, there has been a whole world of memes created from D&#333;mo-kun (including the &lt;a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Grue"&gt;Grues on Uncyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;).

Susannah moves to Japan and joins, and they also recruit three new candidates: fujoshi Rika Yoshitake and Mirai Yajima, and crossdresser Kenjiro Hato.

</answer></question><question Id="36424" Title="Light's actions before hiding his death note" Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently started watching Death Note and have reached episode 17's end.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Light hid his notebook in the jungle, could he not have killed L? I know that L said that would  make Light the prime suspect but what if he writes the cause of death to be a slowly degentrative disease like Huntington's (which would make it VERY ironic given how proud L is of his track record)? He can make it kill L early by specifying his date of death like he did with Ray Penber's fianc&#233;. And L would become less and less useful as he loses control over his body.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This method would be especially convincing since no one has yet (as far as I have seen in the series) discovered that he can determine the cause of people's death.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36425">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-Universe Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;
Simply because he can't. &lt;strong&gt;Light doesn't know L's name to write in the Death Note&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;You also have to realise L's intelligence and the level of wits they are matching. L made tremendous precautions and implied to Light that he knew how the Note works. He had also made it clear that if he died in the near future, Light is to be the primary suspect for Kira. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionaly, the write has given us multiple Rules of Deathnote. Among them the following relate to this scenario. The 23 day rule plays into the fact that 23 days is in the near future and L dying in that period would make the police suspicious of Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you write die of disease with a specific disease's name and the person's time of death, there must be a sufficient amount of time for the disease to progress. If the set time is too tight, the victim will die of a heart attack after 6 minutes and 40 seconds after completing the Death Note.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you write, die of disease for the cause of death, but only write a specific time of death without the actual name of disease, the human will die from an adequate disease. But the &lt;strong&gt;Death Note can only operate within 23 days (in the human calendar)&lt;/strong&gt;. This is called the 23 day rule.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you write die of disease like before with a specific disease's name, but without a specific time, if it takes more than 24 days for the human to die the 23 day rule will not take effect and the human will die at an adequate time depending on the disease. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Use: XXVII/XXVIII&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may also be physically impossible for Deathnote to give a genetic disease. So L may still die from a Heart Attack. Though we have no idea about L's family since he was indeed an orphan.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease#Genetics" rel="nofollow"&gt;Huntington's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out-Universe Explanation&lt;/strong&gt; You need to remember this is an Anime, and using such obscure tactics wouldn't make it easily understandable. The point is to understand this is indeed a fantasy thriller anime, that is meant to be an engaging match of wits and not knowledge. Light is just a high school student and not a medical doctor who is trying to find out obscure ways to kill the individual. Point I am trying to make is that the "Rules of Death Note" may be a writing device to cover such plot holes, but they may or may not be enough to cover all.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;From my understanding, there are three SDFs:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The SDF-1 which was the major focus of the first season.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The SDF-3 which is the flagship of the Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF), where Rick Hunter is.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The SDF-2 I wasn't too sure about, as at first I thought it was a separate ship built, but it was apparently destroyed with the SDF-1 in the final episode of the first season.

It includes a listing for SDF-M, but I don't think that was in the TV series (it's mentioned in the Robotech comics). Wikipedia also has a list of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Robotech_vehicles" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robotech vehicles&lt;/a&gt; that has a lot of detailed information of 1-4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDF-1&lt;/strong&gt;: Robotech TV series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDF-2 Megalord&lt;/strong&gt;: Robotech TV series (starting from episode 26)&lt;/li&gt;

</answer><answer Id="38093">&lt;p&gt;What is canon and what is non canon in Robotech is a mess, but basically the Robotech series, and the Robotech Shadow Chronicles and Robotech Love Live Alive movies are canon and the rest of movies (Robotech The Sentinels and Robotech the Untold Story) and novels and most comics are not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are 4 canon SDF that you could count as "real". There are more in novels and such but they are non canon versions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canon SDFs are SDF-1 and SDF2 which appears in the canon Robotech series (well sort of, the SDF-2 is mentioned but never seen in the series) . The SDF-3 appears in the non canon Robotech The Sentinels movie so because of this it shouldnt count, but it also appears in the canon SDF-3 Shadow Chronicles movie, so you could count it as "real" because of this. The SDF-4 appears in the canon Robotech series and in the canon Robotech Shadow Chronicles movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also what is canon might change over the years, the first 2 Robotech movies when they were made were meant to be canon (and they had its creator involved) but they were de-canonized later.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In manga, chapter 647, I saw that First Hokage's wood clone was able hear the discussion between original (Edo-Tensei) Hashirama and Madara Uchiha. Is this possible? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have seen that Yamato's wood clone was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; able to communicate with his original, that's why he was using earpiece. I also know that, once the shadow-clones are &lt;strong&gt;cancelled&lt;/strong&gt; the original user will get its experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6491">&lt;p&gt;To understand this you need to dive a bit deeper into the wood style cloning technique&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A clone that is created by using chakra to alter the user's own cells into vegetation. The clones can be as simple in function as a wooden dummy for use in the Body Replacement Technique or completely mobile and able to perform techniques. They have the ability to travel far from the user and are able to communicate with the original. &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Wood_Clone_Technique" rel="nofollow"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how complicated you make the wood clone yourself it will even be able to communicate. Yamato also should be able to communicate with his wood clone, although this might be harder for him as he does have some of hashiramas cells. But is not as strong/ chakra rich as him &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because they share the same cells, Yamato is able to track its location, communicate with it over long distances, and absorb any information it has gathered by laying his hand on it. Yamato can also use a seed form variant to this technique that operates in the same way: he is able to track anyone that he plants the seeds on by its response to his chakra. &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Yamato" rel="nofollow"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Let's say if he swapped Nami and Doflamingo's soul, it would so easy for him to defeat him that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why didn't Law swap Doflamingo's soul to make the fight easier?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="54188">&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 690 of the manga, Law is facing off against Vergo, while at the same time talking to Doflamingo. When Vergo shows off his full body Armament Haki, Doflamingo states to Law that "Even your severing powers can do nothing to the strength of his Haki!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strongly implies that Armament Haki is able to offer some level of resistance against the effects of certain Devil Fruit powers, Law's being one of them. It is reasonable to assume that Doflamingo's proficiency with Haki is better than Law's, therefore he had increased resistance against Law's powers, such as the soul-switching ability. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In his encounter with Crablante before he started training, Saitama is hit by him and thrown away like 30 meters or more, and then hit again 2 more times with those gigantic claws Crablante has. If Saitama was a regular human, how could he support this beating and still stand like it was nothing and fight back?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38173">&lt;p&gt;Seems like Saitama doesn't really know he has it before then. From what I remember, Genos said when he was train fighting with Saitama that he wanted to show or let know what Saitama's power really is, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43206">&lt;p&gt;If Saitama was able to even attempt to do his physical training regimen of 100 pushups/ 100 situps and 10km run, he had to be physically capable to a certain extent to even attempt something as vigorous. So even at that time, he might've been as strong enough to be a high ranked C class hero or low ranked B class hero perhaps. Also, Crablante is only a Tiger threat level monster.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="55601">&lt;p&gt;Just saying, the hundred push-ups stuff is what Saitama thinks is the reason for his incredible power. And remember Saitama isn't exactly the smartest person to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard somewhere that the reason Saitama is so strong is due to the fact that he broke his "limiter". Now there isn't much information on this but I imagine that it works like this: every person has a limiter based on who they are. This limiter determines how strong they can get mentally and physically. So in Saitama's case he not only trained really hard but also gave everything and when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before he became super strong he had no job, no family, no friends, he basically had nothing to live for. As Crablante said "I see that you have lifeless eyes." "From one pair of lifeless eyes to another I will let you live." (Something along those lines, but you get the point.) Back to the limiter. What I am trying to say is that Saitama gave it his all, his desire so strong that he broke the barrier that stops everyone from becoming too strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my main theory on why Saitama is so strong. Now there's this other theory about him eating all his enemies to become stronger and stuff, but that's a whole other story. (I mean no offence to anyone as this is only opinion on this topic. The people who make One Punch Man probably have this completely different explanation on why Saitama is so powerful.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bourto by extension does not have a Tailed Beast inside of him, so he would not have nearly as much chakra as his father.&lt;/p&gt;

Is Atomic Samurai speed in the same level of Flashy Flash?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53158">&lt;p&gt;I can give at best a partial answer.  The part I can give are the databook pages concerning Atomic Samurai and Flashy Flash:
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uUYKA.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uUYKA.jpg" alt="Atomic samurai databook, in Japanese"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their statblocks are nearly identical, and the one stat they have a max rating in is the same.  &lt;a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/2000121-anime-and-manga-other-titles/72639438" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;According to a post in a gamefaqs thread&lt;/a&gt; the stats listed in order are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Tairyoku)Physical strength/Stamina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Chiryoku)Intelligence &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Seigi-kan)Sense of Justice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(hero-specific ability rating)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've bolded the one stat they both have at maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these are not objective stat blocks, they are stat blocks from the perspective of the Heroes Association (or possibly Genos, as there's a Saitama stat block later that's specifically from Genos's perspective).  King, for example, has max stats in every single category, which we know to not be objectively accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="41694" Title="Can Sarada Uchiha activate the rinnegan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Sarada Uchiha is the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura. Sasuke has Karin's Chakra (through Uzumaki blood line, being the descendants of Asura &#332;tsutsuki) too, since he had used her ability to heal himself by drinking her blood.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Karin wore glasses and the fact that Sarada needs to wear glasses, may be a hints to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My question is, if Sarada possess Indra's and Asura's Chakra, can she awaken the Rinnegan, as the way Sasuke had did?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41711">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sasuke has Karin's Chakra (through Uzumaki blood line, being the descendants of Asura &#332;tsutsuki) too, since he had used her ability to heal himself by drinking her blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all I would like to correct this misconception. Sasuke obtained his rinnegan powers After receiving half of Hagoromo &#332;tsutsuki's chakra, not by drinking the blood of karin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninjutsu haven't been shown to have any form of lingering chakra effects, making it highly unlikely this one would have had. The chakra would likely be used up immediately to heal said critical wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to your original question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My question is, if Sarada possess Indra's and Asura's Chakra, can she awaken the Rinnegan, as the way Sasuke had did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, if she has both types of chakra, which is highly likely due to Sasuke having both, she could. But not in the same way as Sasuke did, as this would require Hagoromo &#332;tsutsuki's to sacrfice his chakra to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the likelihood she will active the rinnegan is close to non, as this would require larger amounts of Asura and Indra's chakra. Which even took Madara decades while actively producing the chakra through DNA infusion.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44230">&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not she will be able to activate rinnegan. Why? Cause only when the two sons of SOSP (Indra and Ashura), they make Hagoromo's chakra. But since Sarada isnt an Indra reincarnate, she cant get the rinnegan&lt;/p&gt;

But we only see the inside of the section where the main characters work. That last scene shows that there are a lot more employees in the store and that they work in sections divided by other topics. It seems like there are sections dedicated to items intended for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is the topic of the section we see? What are the topics of other sections?

&lt;p&gt;There have been no blatant indications in the manga or anime to show that he will get his Nen back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most other shonen manga's you would expect a protagonist who loses their powers to eventually regain them stronger or in a different way.  This is best seen in Bleach where Ichigo and his allies does this many times. As Hunter x Hunter frequently is designed to subvert expectations, however, there is no reason to presume Gon will get his powers back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Those are pictures are from the book &lt;a href="http://obluda.wikia.com/wiki/Obluda" rel="nofollow"&gt;Obluda, Kter&#225; Nem&#225; Sv&#233;

 language. It was first introduced in the anime at episode 37 and in
 chapter 71 in the manga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to get the Rinnegan if you are not in the Senju or Uchiha clan (including branch clans such as Uzumaki) and inject Senju and Uchiha DNA into yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18617">&lt;p&gt;To awaken the Rinnegan, it's not enough to be a Senju with Uchiha eyes or vice versa, you must be Indra's successor that obtained chakra from Asura's successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successor does not necessarily come directly from the Senju clan, as Naruto, who is an Uzumaki, is a successor. However, Indra's successor is always an Uchiha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, no. It's not possible to do what you describe.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18670">&lt;p&gt;My answer is yes, but only by nature of technicality. This method is possible, though highly improbable. It may in fact not have a prayer of working at all. However, let me lay out this plan for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we know that creatures like the Tailed Beasts can be sealed within a host body. The host body then can gain the power of the sealed Tailed Beast. We also know that a human soul can be sealed, though whether it is possible to seal another person inside one's self is not explicitly shown (to my knowledge anyway). We have, however, seen the souls of all the first four Hokage being sealed within the Shinigami as part of the Reaper Death Seal. Putting these elements together, I think it would be safe to assume it is at least possible for one person to use a similar sealing method as used on the Tailed Beasts to incorporate another human being into themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; We also know from Obito and Kakashi that the entire chakra and essence of a person's Kekkei Genkai can be placed into another person's body. This is what allowed Kakashi to make use of the full power of Obito's eyes as well as Susanoo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Now, for the final piece of information before this can all come together, we know that the requirements for activating the Rinnegan, which, as explained by Black Zetsu, is to bring together the chakra of Indra and Asura, thus giving you the chakra of their father. Therefore, if you could actually seal whoever the current successor of Indra and Asura are, then in this given hypothetical scenario, a third party could in fact gain a Rinnegan.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 In no shape or form would I consider this natural, and I'm sure there are a lot of questionable morals involved with the entire idea, but through this strange course of action or something similar in nature, I believe it is possible to gain the Rinnegan even as someone who was not born with either Indra or Asura's chakra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, it's a crazy, loophole kind of a way of going about it. But hey, you asked for possibility, not plausibility or even likelihood. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35833">&lt;p&gt;No it is not possible, forces unknown decide who gets the rinnegan and when, only in times of great discord is it possible for tose who can attain great power to change the world may by chance awaken their rinnegan, such as Madara and Nagato&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="48715">&lt;p&gt;No it&#8217;s not possible, Orochimaru probably tried countless of times to replicate the scenario, but only Madara got lucky; Madara, while being alive, was able to unlock the Rinnegan near his death.. He was reincarnation of Indra was well...and probably had the purest connection to Indra next to Sasuke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know in order to get Rinnegan, the person must have Indra and Ashura cells (not just Uchiha and Senju, because the person needs to be more related to Hagoromo), But it&#8217;s extremely hard to match the right genes. Madara, being the reincarnation of Indra and Hashirama being reincarnation Ashura is your best chance...other Uchihas will not even come close. After that, it will take years to even unlock it, and who know what events need to take place...
I think Obito had Hashirama cells in him if I recall, but he was never able to unlock Rinnegan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of Episode 5 is literally "Plunging into (the) atmosphere" (officially, its "Reentry to Earth" ). Implying some sort of double entendre, likely implying illicit intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't comment much on the style of writing in particular, but overall such an abstruse wording is not uncommon in literary Japanese. The Japanese people seem to enjoy euphemizing and beating around the bush in their writings. The specific nuances are very difficult to translate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://www.durf.org/2004/07/26/untranslatability/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Natsume Soseki once taught his students that the correct Japanese translation for &#8220;I love you&#8221; is &#8220;Tsuki ga tottemo aoi naa&#8221; (The moon is so blue tonight); what he meant was that to express within the Japanese cultural framework the same emotion expressed in English by &#8220;I love you,&#8221; one must choose words like &#8220;The moon is so blue tonight.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The story is basically about 10 different girls/ladies either involving in or committing 10 different kinds of crimes, where their special powers are shown. Their special powers originate from their ribbons, which were given to them by a mad scientist. The magical girl, who also gets her power from the mad scientist, decides that the mad scientist is the root of all the evil and beats him up. The mad scientist then reveals that there are other girls whom he had modified before, and their power source is their ribbons. Thence, the magical girl goes on a mission to retrieve all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I know that Maria and Mamoru&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; escaped the village and erased their tracks, making it impossible for even their own friends to locate them. The Bakenezumi (I do not know the canon transliteration) even assisted their escape by preparing fake remains for the villagers to find, so as to convince them of Maria and Mamoru's death.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, the Bakenezumi are later shown to have possession of&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? Could it be that Maria and Mamoru&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; were captured by Squealer and forced to have a child?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the ethics committee later commented that&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; the remains they found matched entirely to the DNA records of the village. Does that mean that the remains really belonged to Maria and Mamoru, and they were killed after they were deemed to be of no use?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does the novel explain this? I apologize if i jump to paranoid conclusions, but this possibility sounds too scary.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3096">&lt;p&gt;Although it was not explicitly stated in the Anime. The following sequence of events was strongly implied and was part of Squealer's master plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squealer helps Maria and Mamoru escape. Furthermore, he lets them stay and live with the colony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squealer waits for (or sweet-talks) Maria and Mamoru into having a child.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the child is born, Squealer (and/or his fellow rats) kills Maria and Mamoru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They take the child and raise him/her. ("him" in the Novel, "her" in the Anime)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squealer then takes the bones of Maria and Mamoru and gives them to the ethics committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Squealer says that he will prepare fake remains for the villagers to find and that it will "take some time". He really means the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; remains of Maria and Mamoru and that it will "take some time" for them to have a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole purpose of this was to get a human child that could be raised into an Akki* and used against humans in Squealer's pursuit of world domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*I use Akki for short. But they really aren't. In reality, the children raised by the rats will believe themselves to be rats, thus attack inhibition and death-feedback will apply to rats instead of humans.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14341">&lt;p&gt;I think its pretty obvious that Maria and Mamoru are dead if the etheics comittee found the remains had their DNA in it.. Not to mention that squeeler managed to take their child from them..&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39325">&lt;p&gt;If we consider that everything said and implied make sense (story most likely don't imply anything without a purpose), we could even propose a darker possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's obvious that they were both killed, we can't be sure about when. I would say the rats could have used brain surgery as they did for their queen to dispose of Maria after she went pregnant. (It's implied "what if they did it to human ?") We don't know if the council got the full squeletal or not. If not, they could have disposed of some of the body parts without killing them in order to give evidences to the council before the 10 month needed to give birth.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41894">&lt;p&gt;For me they did to them what they did to their queen. 
Saki asked to Satoru in the anime &lt;em&gt;if they do something like this to a human&lt;/em&gt; (and give up on questioning). But I don't understand why in the end she neither mentions it when talking with Squealer. When it is said that they are really dead, she should have realized that squealer was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49887">&lt;p&gt;The (short/long) answer. Maria and Mamoru stayed in squealers colony. In the time that they stayed there, they began to get closer to one another. Since the child is about 9 years old, they must have been together for just about three years. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how long they stayed in squealers colony, but from the manga and the implications of the anime. Maria and Mamoru clearly had a child, and weren&#8217;t entirely trusting of squealers colony.From what was said in the manga. Mamoru, at the time, wasn&#8217;t there to protect Maria after she had her child and was tricked and killed. Upon Mamoru&#8217;s return, he was also killed and their child was stolen by Squealer. By the end, Maria and Mamoru make there way to the heaven kotatsu with Shun &amp;amp; Reiko. After a few years Messiah (Maria &amp;amp; Mamoru&#8217;s Child), arrives in heaven and sits down in the Kotatsu with his cold mother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, they all joke in heaven about how long it&#8217;ll take for Saki to come join them.&lt;/p&gt;

This lasted for a very short period (Danzo died fighting Sasuke) and Tsunade soon recovered and was, once again, appointed as the Hokage. &lt;strong&gt;So next will/should come the Rokudaime again and Danzo should be ignored, or should we move on to the Shichidaime/Nanadaime (not sure about this) Hokage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10; I ask this because some people and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leafninja.com/kage.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; consider Danzo only a temporary Hokage (in this logic we're still missing the 6th, so the next should be it). However, something similar has happened with the succession from 3rd (Hiruzen) to 4th (Minato) and back to 3rd (and later came Tsunade, the 5th). From this point of view, the next to succeed should be the seventh.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="319">&lt;p&gt;No. This is exactly the same case with the Third and the Fourth. The Third retired, and the Fourth was nominated. After the Fourth died, the Third retook the position, until the Fifth arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Conclusion: The next Hokage would probably be the Seventh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A practical example would be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, the Israeli prime minister who fell to coma. He was replaced with Ehud Olmert, who is now referred to as an "ex-prime minister". He's also counted in the prime minister list.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="336" Title="Why are there so many fillers in long-running animes?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The most obvious answer everyone over the Internet is giving to this question is &quot;Because anime is produced much faster compared to manga, they need to put in fillers in order to slow down the anime series&quot;. However, that shouldn't be the only reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, consider One Piece. The show is going on for more than 500 episodes, and less than 10% are fillers. Comparing that to Naruto, the show has almost the same number of episodes (original and Shippuuden combined), but almost 50% of its episodes are fillers. Needless to say, the manga of Naruto is so far ahead that the anime won't be able to catch up even if they produce 100+ episodes without any fillers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="338">&lt;p&gt;That is mainly because battle centered animes, like Naruto or Bleach have a lot of battle scenes. Battle scenes are much &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster in Anime than it is in Manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot centered animes, like One Piece or Death Note, can afford not to produce as many fillers, because they can leave the gap far enough apart, as plot events unfold not as much faster in Anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Naruto specific answer, the upcoming saga is filled with battles, in order to compensate for the fast-pace anime, a sufficient gap needs to be opened. I don't have exact numbers or calculations, but I'd like to think that the anime producers do have some sort of plan, and that they would keep the upcoming battle saga intact. &lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Otherwise, guess who'll be delivering meteors to their houses&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="339">&lt;p&gt;There are lots of possible explanations to that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you said, the anime catching up to the manga, so they have more time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special events, as anniversaries, movie-related specials or so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the narratives are different and that depends on the production team. In your example, Naruto (as Bleach did) commonly makes battles really fast-paced, so they tend to catch-up with the manga quickly. Whereas One Piece, while having lots of battle too, tends to make them less dynamic, so in the end, they are longer and don't catch up to manga as easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="341">&lt;p&gt;An anime is typically adapted from another source material. Usually it's either a manga, a light novel series (like Haruhi), or even visual novel/computer game (Little Busters!, the When They Cry series).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some parts maybe cut, changed, rearranges, and sometimes new content is added all together scenes completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some changes are welcomed by fans, most are not. One most unwelcome additions are the so called filler episodes. A filler episode can be as short as 1 episode, or as long as an entire season of the anime. These episodes were not a part of the original source content's story, and usually serve absolutely no purpose in furthering the main story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the two main reasons that we see fillers because they are meant to buy time for the anime when the content catches up to the pace the source material. This delay give the authors some time to adapt more material for the anime. After all, you can't really adapt something that doesn't exist yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason for fillers to exist is greed. Some productions like to milk an anime for more money by making a few episodes of filler in a season, to add to disc sales (so fan buy &lt;em&gt;n+1&lt;/em&gt; discs instead of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;). Anime productions usually make the bulk of their money in disc sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, fans don't like fillers for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are pointless, and don't add to the plot of character development in any menaingful way. Sometimes it takes away from the action and go on bizarre tangets only to end up exactly where they began (it's was all a dream!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They sometimes add plotholes or other contradictions to storyline and a considered non-canonical. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They (usually) aren't written by the same author as the original source material, so the quality and vision of the story might not be up to standards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I did not read all the comments under your question and did not see that you already knew that much, here is the rest of my answer;  This also explains why Soifon would never have witnessed Yoruichi using the technique, because it was unsuitable for battle.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In 2012, there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_%28anime%29&quot;&gt;an anime titled &lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or sometimes &lt;strong&gt;K Project&lt;/strong&gt;). Does the title mean anything in the context of the anime? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(cf. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28anime%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was titled for the word &quot;Control&quot;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_%28manga%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was supposedly titled after the use of the letter &quot;x&quot; as a variable).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5455">&lt;p&gt;There are two possibilities for what the "K" refers to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Adolf K. Weismann, who is the original person that became Yashiro Isana, the main character of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is "King". The leader of each clan is its King, who controls the members of the clan.  Weismann is a King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KINGS is also the first opening theme of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13496">&lt;p&gt;I'll put together @poop's and @kuwaly's answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two possibilities are are "K" for "King" or for Adolf "K" Weismann. However, the second for Weismann is incorrect. Wiki: &lt;a href="http://k-project.wikia.com/wiki/Yashiro_Isana" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://k-project.wikia.com/wiki/Yashiro_Isana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research as well as a search through the K-Project wiki, I found that Adolf's middle name isn't actually revealed in either the anime or any sources. Due to his middle name not being known, we can see that it is of little importance to the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's jump to the title of the last episode title, "King." We can piece the title of the anime together with the title of the final episode as the anime was leading up to the final episode, uniquely named, "King." "King," is the most likely of the two options since the plot line, use of the word "King" and the name of the final episode all relate to the one word, "King."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the title of the anime would be, "King-Project," or "King."&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a few Dragon Ball Z scenes in which Androids 16, 17 and 18 ride a truck despite the fact that they are capable of flight. It grants extra time to the heroes to recover (such as in Goku's case) and think about or prepare for what to do next, like exploring Cell's egg, or merging Picollo with Kami. To me, it seems both unreasonable and humorous at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I don't understand the reason for why the producers/storywriters decided to do this. Is there any reason given for this strange choice? Could it be some kind of plot hole or plot device?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="16724">&lt;p&gt;There was a specific reason why they were using the car:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17 and 18 weren't that emotionally invested in killing Goku, and they were just  killing time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They knew that taking a car was impractical, but they took one anyway because android 17 felt like it&lt;/p&gt;

The closest thing to an official genre title that you would get is, "post-apocalyptic". Post-apocalyptic settings are those that take place after the end of the world. in certain instances the end of the world does not mean the end of humanity and so they start the world anew. I would recommend searching post-apocalyptic animes if reborn society is what you are into. Attack On Titan, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet, and Murder Princess, are all examples of animes with functional societies that speak of "technology from the old world", even though the ancient technology is futuristic by comparison to their own.

I personally prefer the term Dystopia but it's basic definition is an "undesirable place" and doesn't have to mean "regressing into a lesser advanced civilization" but most of the time I find them in tandem on stories.&lt;/p&gt;

The flashes can be fired from both hands simultaneously. Senpou: Inton Raiha uses Sage of Six Path's chakra.

And how they acquire it by birth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50602">&lt;p&gt;Not a manga reader but based on what I was able to search on the Internet, &lt;em&gt;it is still a mystery and the whole truth isn't quite revealed yet&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, it is still not known as to how it is acquired or if it can be acquired by someone consciously. It is, however, known that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...all share a similar faith in their own (and others') dreams and/or destiny. When a "D." appears, the general consensus is that they are going to stir things up on a global scale, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The second thing about the D is the "Inherited Will" which passes down generation from generation according to Roger and Whitebeard. Even if the life of the person is extinguished others will take up their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also from the &lt;a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_the_D." rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, only Gol D. Roger from among those who carry the 'D' in their name was able to know the whole meaning and truth behind. If I understand correctly, what he knew has not yet been revealed in the manga. There are a number of theories about this in the Internet which you can look up if you are interested but bear in mind that &lt;em&gt;these are just theories so there is no definite conclusion as to what it is exactly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went to the wiki page for &lt;a href="http://kskm.wikia.com/wiki/Kohinata_Minoru" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kohinata Minoru&lt;/a&gt; and found that the last two symbols in his name, matched the last two on his belt (those being &#28023;&#27969;). Looking these up, I found that they mean "ocean current" (or Kairy&#363;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working my way up the symbols in the belt, I saw that the second one closely resembled &#21521;. When looking &#21521; up, I found that it meant toward (or Mukai).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the closest thing that I could find to the top symbol is &#12422;. When looking this up, I get Yu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting all of these symbols together, my best literal guess for what is written on the best is Yu k&#333; kairy&#363;, or Yukata ocean current. However, considering how closely a lot of the symbols on the belt match his Japanese name &#23567;&#26085;&#21521;&#28023;&#27969;, my best guess would be that his name is what is written on the belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/93/kuwaly"&gt;Kuwaly&lt;/a&gt; showed me that the entirety of the Japanese name &#23567;&#26085;&#21521;&#28023;&#27969; is shown on the belt. Therefore, it is just his name that is written on the belt.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="36270" Title="Why was it so easy to defeat Toneri, Kinshiki and Momoshiki?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Toneri had somewhat the same Goal as Madara. Madara gained Hagoromo's Power and Toneri, Hamura's. The both powers are, I believe equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharingan &gt;&gt; Rinnegan = Byakugan &gt;&gt; Tenseigan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He who awakens the Rinnegan, shall receive the Powers of Hagoromo and he who awakens the Tenseigan shall receive the Powers of Hamura. Which is exactly what happened. BUT... Toneri had the Power of Hamura, who has the equivalent Power as Hagoromo... Then, how was Naruto able to finish Toneri's Tenseigan (and the Powers of Hamura) away with one blow?? + just in Nine Tails Mode, without his Six Paths Powers.. It just doesn't add up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now.. let's move to the Movie Boruto:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kinshiki and Momoshiki are &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; powerful beings... Momoshiki even has 3 Rinnegan (One in his Forehead, and one in each palm) and has also the equivalent, if not greater Power to those of Kaguya.... how the hell was he defeated by only Boruto (a child)? While it took &lt;strong&gt;Naruto &amp;amp; Sasuke&lt;/strong&gt; to seal away (not defeat) Kaguya and they both had the Six Paths Powers, while Boruto had none whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39172">&lt;p&gt;Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byakugan is weaker than the Sharingan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toneri was not a Hyuuga before he started his world domination. Madara was actually an Uchiha, therefore he had the immediate access to all Sharingan powers. Toneri didn't have immediate access to Byakugan. Not to mention the fact that the Hyuuga kept the Byakugan a heavily guarded secret. So much to the fact that they had to create a seal for the branch family. One reason Sharingan was so easy to just obtain, is that the Uchiha didn't put in extra effort to guard their eyes. That is because only those who have a strong will can have the Sharingan. Sharingan is much much harder to obtain than Byakugan because you are not born with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39750">&lt;p&gt;Naruto and Sasuke during Boruto saga are way stronger than the version in the war arc, so any actual threat that is Kaguya or even just slightly above her is not gonna do much against them and did so because they were nerfed in the movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how Boruto's rasengan finished the enemy is because Naruto used his chakra to charge it and you can expect that his rasengan is going to be over powered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are reasons I believe so, as you can't expect them to be same level when they fought Kaguya as they did not have experience with their power and it's already shown in this series and many other that you become more powerful as you grow older until certain age.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44999">&lt;p&gt;Technically, neither of them were easy. It took 5 kages + Sasuke to defeat Momoshiki &amp;amp; Kinshiki. As for Toneri reducing production cost's technical factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transplanted Byakugan and evolved it into Tenseigan minutes before starting to fight Naruto. Even assuming he knew about its powers, he won't have instant mastery over it.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was fighting BSM Naruto even if part of Kyuubi was separated, he was actually powering golem that it was fighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was trying to ram Moon into Earth all while fighting Naruto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, people mostly forget to mention that guy is in similar age group as Naruto &amp;amp; co. So, no help there. Well, he seems quite knowledgeable (Otsutsuki factor), but still no extra time to develop chakra.  &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47831">&lt;p&gt;Actually, Naruto and Sasuke were vastly inferior in power to when they fought Kaguya. They no longer had Six Paths power, Naruto could only use Kurama, and Sasuke Susanoo and he only had 1 arm left! It's just that Kaguya is vastly stronger than the other members of her clan. In fact, she's vastly stronger than all other characters in Naruto, she is the god of the Naruto verse after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole Momoshiki greater threat was hype-crap. They got beat by a simple large Rasengan made by Boruto and a weakened Naruto on his base-form while Kaguya took 9 Rasenshurikens at once. She didn't even absorb them, she just tanked them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By feats, Momo and Kinshiki were below Madara, let alone Kaguya, who Sasuke stated on his thoughts to be far stronger than Madara.&lt;/p&gt;

Similarly, Shou Tucker's experimentation on his wife and daughter surely should count as a form of human transmutation, but his body appears to be intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess would be that "playing God" is mostly at stake in attempted resurrections of the dead because the alchemist there is trying to reverse death, which is meant to be impossible. (Some posters in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FullmetalAlchemist/comments/21pr3j/shou_tucker_spoilers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this Reddit thread on Shou Tucker&lt;/a&gt; argue similarly.) Those other transmutations that one might consider to be "playing God" might be morally suspect (much much more so than trying to resurrect a loved one), but they do not transgress the boundaries of life and death and attempt to reverse the natural flow from life to death in quite the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

They could have kept all the brand and billboard the same as they are in real life, but instead, they made so many subtle changes (while the maid cafe remains almost entirely intact).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since many of these easter eggs are placed in a very obvious position, and animating such a complicated background asks a large amount of effort. I don't really believe these are purely the animator having fun. Are there any other reasons? Like copyright or advertising? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

&lt;p&gt;Replacing brand names is a fairly common phenomenon in media. As &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51011/why-oreimo-changed-the-actual-brand-name-in-akihabara#comment65979_51011"&gt;Dimitri mx mentions&lt;/a&gt;, this is probably because the studios want to avoid using &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark" rel="noreferrer"&gt;trademarks&lt;/a&gt; to play it safe. This is why parody names like "WcDonalds" and "EcDonalds" are so common in anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toradora&lt;/em&gt; casts a snarky lampshade on this practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/animeoffbrands/comments/7q966u/sudohbucks/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RC7ZY.png" alt="&amp;quot;Sudoh-bucks&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Why hasn&amp;#39;t this place been sued yet?&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the anime actually does use the real names, if they get the product placement properly arranged behind the scenes. For example, this was the case with Pizza Hut in &lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;. (Hence the "Pizza Hut supports the Rebellion" memes.) For more detail, see &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4257/have-there-been-any-anime-with-actual-product-placement"&gt;Have there been any anime with actual product placement?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, taking the steps to formally arrange this kind of thing requires more effort and comes with more risk, so I can see why anime productions tend to go with the less risky parody names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi_Score_Girl" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Score Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This manga got into legal trouble because it directly featured lots of 90s video game content, even though its publisher, Square Enix, took steps to secure formal consent for the use of the games' characters from the various companies. In 2014, SNK Playmore &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-06/hi-score-girl-manga-recalled-after-snk-copyright-charges/.77361" rel="noreferrer"&gt;launched an IP violation claim&lt;/a&gt; against Square Enix because of this manga, which resulted in the recall of all the volume and digital publications of the manga. It took about a year before the two parties reached a settlement and the lawsuit was withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case had more to do with copyright than trademark, but it's still a good example of the kind of trouble that could come arise if you're not careful enough with handling the intellectual property of others... &lt;em&gt;High Score Girl&lt;/em&gt; really did include a lot of stuff though, so this was a particularly complex case. For reference, here's the copyright notice in volume 1 of the manga:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(card_game)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is a westernized verison of the japanese game "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daifug%C5%8D" rel="noreferrer"&gt;daifug&#333;&lt;/a&gt;" (perhaps that is the actual game, but localized) where it ranges from the daifug&#333; (Grand millionaire) to the Daihinmin (Extreme Needy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a variant which allows "revolutions"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a player leads out with four of a kind, the hierarchy of all the cards will be reversed. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;For example, if 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A,2 is the typical order of power (from left to right), after four of a kind is played it would be the reverse of that: 2,A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If another four of a kind is played, the order would switch back. Revolutions are typically utilized in the game to create better balance and avoid having the same player remain in first position indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of the game of course is to be the highest ranking person :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that, for some reason, the garb was initially portrayed as blue in the anime. However, the official cover of volume 49 of the manga portrays it as green (the &lt;em&gt;Kazekage&lt;/em&gt; is in the top left here, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvJY2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;em&gt;Mizukage&lt;/em&gt; should be the one who has the blue garb; this appears to be an error in the anime. However, as you noticed, it was corrected in &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; episode 199 and forward.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kazekage?oldid=750780#Trivia" rel="noreferrer"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; Wiki]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="23379" Title="How did the Incubators start making Magical Girls?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The deal the Incubators make to girls is that by granting one wish that a girl desires they become a Magical Girl and fight Witches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We know that Witches are in fact Magical Girls, so I am wondering how did the Incubators first start making the Magical Girls when there were no Witches to fight (as there were no Magical Girls to become Witches)?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23380">&lt;p&gt;Witches are not needed for the Incubators. Witches are needed for the survival of the magical girls. The Incubators could not care less about what happens to the magical girls as long as there are enough girls to turn into Puella Magis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Kyubey"&gt;The sole purpose of the Incubators making Puella Magis is to generate energy.&lt;/a&gt; There would be no need to have witches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is another explanation. &lt;a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Familiar#Familiar"&gt;Familiars can form from Puella Magis before they turn into a witch.&lt;/a&gt; Since Familiars can become witches themselves, it's possible for the first Puella Magis to encounter witches.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="23381">&lt;p&gt;AFAIK, there is no requirement for making magical girls except the wish. The wish is a "requirement" for payment of the contract. Thus the very first occurrence only needed the wish. Perhaps subsequent girls have the added "benefit" of destroying witches, but the first one just needed a wish granted, and that could simply be how it started.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="23382">&lt;p&gt;At end of the series, Homura is in a world without witches, yet she is fighting Majuu. It is hinted that they are coagulated form of bad emotions. But unlike witches, they don't seem to grow that strong, being more numerous than witches. This can be seen in their "Grief cubes" being smaller but being more of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would assume that first magical girls were fighting those same Majuu, but the moment they started turning into witches, the Majuu started disappearing, because Witches absorbed all the bad emotions, leaving nothing for Majuu to form from.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="23406">&lt;p&gt;This answer is somewhat speculative, but, I think, not completely off-base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Frosteeze's answer says, the Incubators don't really care at all about witches; the witches are sort of a nasty byproduct of the energy creation process, the same way that burning fossil fuels creates carbon emissions. If I recall correctly, the energy that the Incubators need is released as the magical girl becomes a witch, at the height of her despair. It doesn't matter to them that there's a witch left over afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know the Incubators have no compunctions about hiding information from girls they make contracts with, so I always imagined the first magical girls were created in a scenario like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Incubators land in ancient Sumeria and find some young girls whose emotions are in turmoil. There was a lot for young girls to be in turmoil about in ancient Sumeria, so this was probably not hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Incubators offer to grant the girls' wishes and give them magical powers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The girls agree. They become magical girls, but there are no witches to fight, so they go off and become prophets or great warriors. This requires them to use magic, which causes their soul gems to cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, these girls succumb to despair due to events in their own lives. This was probably quicker and easier to achieve in ancient Sumeria, where life was harder overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first crop of magical girls become witches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next crop of magical girls kills off these witches and starts the whole cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We know the Incubators go back at least to ancient Egypt, since, &lt;a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Madoka_Magica_Episode_11:_The_Only_Signpost_Remaining" rel="noreferrer"&gt;as we discover in Episode 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cleopatra was a magical girl. And nothing about the scenario substantially changes if we assume it was in Egypt instead of Sumeria.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incubators may not care about witches, but having the magical girls fight them is a useful thing for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes the energy harvesting more sustainable. Witches kill people or cause them to kill themselves, as we see in Episodes 2 and 4. If the world gets overrun with witches, the number of potential magical girls reduces. The witches also seem to cause emotional disturbances that, if widespread enough, could discourage people from reproducing, reducing the number of potential magical girls in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It speeds up the process of pushing the magical girls into despair, which also speeds up energy gathering. This is especially relevant in modern day. An ancient Sumerian girl might have her village razed by bandits once per fortnight; a modern Japanese girl's greatest worry is whether her allowance stretches far enough to buy new shoes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stops the girls from getting suspicious about the deal. As soon as a girl thinks "This is too good to be true", the Incubator mentions the requirement to fight witches. That's not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; caveat, but it's enough to make the deal sound more like a bargain and less like a trap. &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eNgb5l.png" alt="fishy deal"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Because Myne is royalty, she didn't betray him for a mere 800 coins, but she was trying to mock of him from the beginning, it has been showed that she is the second princess to the throne, so it is basically just making fun of the degraded hero, proof : &lt;a href="https://shield-hero.fandom.com/wiki/Malty_S_Melromarc" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://shield-hero.fandom.com/wiki/Malty_S_Melromarc&lt;/a&gt; you can find here position as queen&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;After I watched episode 366 of Bleach, I waited for a couple of months. As I expected, no new episode of Bleach anime has been released since then. And yet, I don't believe that the anime has reached the ending.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Bleach anime stop airing? And did Bleach manga also end its serialization? Though for the case of the manga, I am not sure if it has actually finished.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18812">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_%28anime%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the original run of Bleach anime in Japan has finished since March 2012. It seems that you follow the English dub, which &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_episodes#Season_16:_The_Lost_Agent_.282011.E2.80.932012.29" rel="nofollow"&gt;finished airing on November 1st, 2014&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't realize that it stopped airing in Japan long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the reason, from the posts I have seen on the Internet, there seems to be no official reason given for the cancellation of the anime series. (Usually, the official reason will be cited before people give their own interpretation or speculation of the situation, but I don't see any).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://edas88.hubpages.com/hub/Will-Bleach-Return-and-When" rel="nofollow"&gt;This page by edas88&lt;/a&gt; gives 2 theory as for why the series was cancelled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anime was sub-par and had too many fillers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.jp/animesityouritu/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt; for TV anime series viewership rating is reliable or not, but viewership for Bleach started out at around 5%, gradually dropped but still managed to get 2-3% up to the point of Aizen's defeat, but it reduced further and sustained at 1-2% till the point it was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the other two series in the &lt;em&gt;Big 3&lt;/em&gt;, One Piece sustained at around 10% viewership over the same period, and Naruto at 7-9% at the beginning, but still got 3-5% at the point Bleach anime was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_%28anime%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says that 111 of all 366 episodes are fillers.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anime stopped to wait for more material from the manga, instead of continuing with filler episodes as what they had been doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this side, at the time of writing, there are &lt;a href="http://www.idigitaltimes.com/bleach-anime-returns-expect-2015-release-once-manga-finishes-376751" rel="nofollow"&gt;some speculations&lt;/a&gt; that the anime will restart production in 2015, since the manga is expected to end in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing (May 27th, 2015), the manga has not ended its serialization yet. According to &lt;a href="https://www.mangaupdates.com/releases.html?search=35&amp;amp;stype=series" rel="nofollow"&gt;mangaupdates&lt;/a&gt;, chapter 627 was released on May 21st, 2015 by scanlation groups. There is no news headline regarding the imminent end of the serialization (except that it is confirmed to end in 2015), so I think it is going to continue for at least a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="23383" Title="Why does Team Rocket always try to catch Pikachu?" Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; surprised this question has not been asked yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In almost every single episode, at least from the first season all the way through to the Unova region, Team Rocket is trying to catch Pikachu to give him to Giovanni. Why do they do this? They often cite reasoning that this Pikachu is special somehow, but is that actually true? Nobody else really talks about how awesome Pikachu is, and he certainly doesn't seem to win very often.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for any kind of answer, in-universe, out-of-universe, thematic, humourous, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a theory I will post below but wonder if this community could come up with a better answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23384">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short answer: This is Team Rocket's version of "following your dreams"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only answer I've been able to come up with is a thematic one. The Pokemon anime, as with much Bish&#333;nen anime is all about the idea of fulfilling your dreams and never giving up (being the most important part of &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSpirit"&gt;Japanese Spirit&lt;/a&gt;). Ash has his dream of being the best Pokemon Trainer, Misty her dream of being a great Water-type trainer, Brock his dream about being a great breeder. None of these characters could give up on this dream or it would break the theme of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had to pick a "dream" for Jesse, James and Meowth I think it would be to catch Ash's Pikachu. It kind of made sense in the first episode because Pikachu happened to win, but over the series as a whole, Pikachu doesn't seem especially powerful. But it doesn't really matter - Team Rocket could not give up on this dream of catching Pikachu, even though they are the antagonists, because it would break one of the central themes of the show: not giving up on your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't think of any satisfying in-universe logical reason for Team Rocket to continue pursuing Pikachu. There's not really any need to manufacture one, but I'm looking forward to other possible answers that might have thought of something I haven't.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="23385">&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons (and theories. People won't give up with Pok&#233;mon theories &amp;amp; creepy pasta) of why Team Rocket would like to get Ash's Pikachu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The most realistic answer (in my opinion) is that the Team Rocket Leader &lt;i&gt;asked them to.&lt;/i&gt; But why would he want &lt;b&gt;THIS&lt;/b&gt; Pikachu? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the Season one episode "Ash Catches a Pok&#233;mon," when Team Rocket was trying to steal Pikachu, Meowth accidentally says that Ash's Pikachu's power exceeds the power level he would possess as a Raichu (the evolved version of Pikachu). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said in the &lt;a href="http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Ash%27s_Pikachu"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, as an example. (I'll try to update the post with a video link). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which can be interpreted as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ash's Pikachu has got more power than a regular Raichu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the different seasons of Pok&#233;mon, Ash's Pikachu is dunking asses. If you compare it to a regular Pikachu from one of the games, the difference in stats is ridiculous. I mean like... &lt;a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pikachu_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29#Stats"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, Pikachu is one of the few Pok&#233;mon Ash didn't abandon (I mean.. C'mon, he left Charizard, who in the world would be insane enough to do this? What do you mean, Pok&#233;mon have feelings too?), so Ash spent many years training him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can assume that, even if Ash was one of the most incompetent trainer,  &lt;b&gt;Pikachu should be around level 100&lt;/b&gt;, giving the Team Rocket another good reason to try to catch him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Another way to see it (not proven at all, just my personal opinion) is that, more than being stupid, Team Rocket is incredibly &lt;b&gt;stubborn&lt;/b&gt;, as proven by the hundreds of tries of catching Pikachu. They spent years trying to catch Pikachu, what would be the sense of all this time of their lives if they stopped now? They prefer to keep spending their time trying to catch this Pikachu rather than admitting they lost years of their lives for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TL;DR : Pikachu OP &amp;amp; Team Rocket stupid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="23391">&lt;p&gt;This is answered in the very first episode that Team Rocket shows up in (the second episode in the series).  In it, Team Rocket (Jessie, James and Meowth) arrive at the Pok&#233;mon center that Ash and Misty are at - Pikachu is recovering from the events of the previous episode.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, Team Rocket has no interest whatsoever in Ash's Pikachu, and are only really interested in taking &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the infirmed pokemon, disregarding his one ordinary Pikachu completely.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when Pikachu recovers, and with the help of several other Pikachu at the Pok&#233;mon Center, Pikachu manages to defeat Team Rocket in a single attack.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this catastrophic failure, Team Rocket (Jessie, James and Meowth, not the group as a whole) determines that Ash's Pikachu must be "special", and resolve to catch it for their boss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to sum up, the reasons that Jessie, James, and Meowth want Ash's Pikachu so badly are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: It beat them badly with a seemingly impossible level of power.
2: They want to give that "special" Pikachu to their boss.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="23392">&lt;p&gt;At the end of the second episode of the anime (Team Rocket's first appearance), Pikachu generates a large explosion which renders Team Rocket flying into outer space. Shocker (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time we meet Team Rocket (next episode, again, shocker) they tell our friends the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only Pikachu we want is that one.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We're only looking for the rarest, most valuable Pok&#233;mon in the world, kid.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;And that special Pikachu is just the kind of Pok&#233;mon we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As portrayed later in the series, this Team Rocket trio does not have a good standing with Giovanni (anymore) so they try to get him the best Pok&#233;mon they can find to make up for it, which they believe is Pikachu.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="29696">&lt;p&gt;I think that team rocket is always trying to catch ash's pikachu, because team rocket, as long as ash and his pals, haven't aged for just about &lt;strong&gt;20 darn years,&lt;/strong&gt; for the sake of the franchise. They've been with ash in the anime the most, so they've also then seen ash's pikachu countless times, and often times, getting into the &lt;strong&gt;'were blasting off again!'&lt;/strong&gt; phrase. It's only natural that they'd want to capture pikachu, because they want pikachu's amazing power for themselves. How ever, they always fail to capture pika, and I'd like to sorta see a episode where rocket finally catches pikachu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps

</answer></question><question Id="40190" Title="Why can't Alphonse trade his alchemy for Edward's alchemy?" Body="&lt;p&gt;At the end of the FMA: Brotherhood (Fullmetal Alchemist) series, Edward tried to use alchemy and failed because he wanted his brother back and the law of equivalent exchange clearly states that&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Therefore Alphonse's alchemy would be an equal value to Edward's alchemy. so my question is if Edward Elric traded his brother's (Alphonse Elric) body and soul with his alchemy, why can't Alphonse trade his alchemy for Edward's alchemy?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/34097/2604&quot;&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t Edward get back his power to do alchemy?&lt;/a&gt; That question was (in my perspective) saying Ed should use a philosopher's stone to do alchemy, because a philosopher's stone ignores the law of equivalent exchange. My question focuses on the observation that a transmutation by Al to give up his alchemy for Ed's should be a good example of following the law of equivalent exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40203">&lt;p&gt;This is an expansion of my thoughts in &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/34097/2604"&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t Edward get back his power to do alchemy?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no explicit indication that this is impossible, but it would not be in keeping with the tone of the manga (which &lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt; roughly adapts) were Edward able to recover his alchemy. Edward's decision to trade his gate for Alphonse is portrayed as rather final, per Truth's question to him after he proposes the exchange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Gate of Truth exists within everyone. That is how everyone can use alchemy. Will you degrade yourself to an ordinary person, unable to use alchemy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt; points out more explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you sure about this? If you lose your gateway, you'll never be able to use alchemy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus unlikely that the exchange can be reversed; Edward even notes that his recovery of Alphonse is "the Fullmetal Alchemist's final transmutation." Furthermore, the personal nature of the gate makes me doubt that it is possible for someone else to make an exchange for Edward's own gate. (If Edward is the only person who can access his gate and thus, be able to give it away, then he is probably the only person who would be able to exchange it back, in the scenario where regaining one's alchemy is possible.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the issue of whether the exchange is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; possible, Edward also does not really care about regaining his lost abilities. Even if he mourned the loss, it is doubtful that he would let Alphonse sacrifice himself in this manner. (Alphonse notes after the time-skip that Edward does not mind keeping his automail leg "as a reminder" and that "apparently he had no intention of trying to get it back" &amp;mdash; Edward only really cared about recovering Alphonse's body. Surely Edward does not care about being "an ordinary person" who cannot use alchemy, if he is even willing to live with his automail leg.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that when Minato asked him his age after stoping naruto from releasing the Kyuubi's seal, Naruto told him that he was 16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the wiki, it also says that he graduated from the Academy at age 12, &lt;em&gt;some time passed&lt;/em&gt; and we know he spent ~2.5 years away training with Jiraiya so accounting for any time that may have passed, it eventually adds up.&lt;/p&gt;

It's also not seen as a magic ability so he's not considered to be on the other side of the technology/magic divide.  The true nature of the power hasn't been revealed.  Its origins are unknown and the series hints that even Toma doesn't know what its fully capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toma's ranking is confirmed through the annual &lt;a href="https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/System_Scan" rel="noreferrer"&gt;System Scan&lt;/a&gt; tests, which corresponds to the mandatory physical exams that Japanese students have to take every year. The real life exams measure things like height and weight, but the System Scan tests measure student's esper abilities and these tests have always shown that Toma is only a level 0 esper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series also tries to portray Toma's encounters against powerful level 5 espers as a David versus Goliath situation.  A mere level 0 who has the courage to take on the most powerful level 5 espers in Academy City in order to protect his friends.  Given how powerful his Imagine Breaker ability is, this lacks some credibility, but it doesn't stop Toma claiming this himself as he punches someone in the face. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 7 of &lt;em&gt;Ouran&lt;/em&gt;, Renge cosplays (poorly) as Kisaragi Quon from &lt;em&gt;RahXephon&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BS3VLm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;left: Houshakuji Renge; right: Kisaragi Quon&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I suppose it could just be a throwaway reference, given that that &lt;em&gt;Ouran&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RahXephon&lt;/em&gt; are both Bones productions; I'm just wondering if there's any greater depth to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9630">&lt;p&gt;In the designs created by Akihiro Yamada, that were adapted by Hiroki Kanno for the anime, Quon is depicted wearing clothes with a very French motif (e.g. parasol, beret). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V07nom.jpg" alt="Quon illustration"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Vol.2 DVD release (used in France and Japan, but not in the initial U.S. and UK release), Yamada illustrated Quon wearing a frilly lace-trimmed dress and stockings, carrying a parasol for a goth loli look, which was inspired Old French Victorian style dresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M96UDl.jpg" alt="Quon v.2 cover"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="30580" Title="Is doujinshi always sexual?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this has an obvious answer, I'm pretty new to the anime community. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen covers of doujinshi for certain pairings/fandoms I like, but from what I've seen of the contents, most of them get pretty steamy. I really like the concept of fan-published works and seeing certain characters interact, but I don't feel comfortable reading something so...explicit? Are there doujinshi that are based around platonic/fluffy romance interactions, or is this typically the standard for doujinshi? (And is there a way I can tell a platonic doujinshi from others?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="30581">&lt;p&gt;Though it is common for such themes to be done, doujinshi are basically almost always fan made manga/stories, which means they can have any kind of storyline. They are almost never made by professionals or with custom stories, and are instead just derived from a popular story, but with a "What if" scenario, which can be whatever the author of the doujinshi decides it to be. Of course, this usually is Pairings, especially when the main manga does little to satisfy that Romance urge, or even worse, tease it, for those fans. So overall, they do tend to be Sexual, but that is not a necessity for it to be doujinshi.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="30585">&lt;p&gt;The term Doujinshi is rather broad, encompassing any self-published work. Sometimes, although rarely, even big name authors have created some doujinshi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a pretty decent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Djinshi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which defines it as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;D&#333;jinshi (&#21516;&#20154;&#35468;{&#12393;&#12358;&#12376;&#12435;&#12375;}), often transliterated as doujinshi) is the Japanese term for self-published works, usually magazines, manga or novels. D&#333;jinshi are often the work of amateurs, though some professional artists participate as a way to publish material outside the regular industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These self-published works are almost always inspired by work created by someone else, rather than being original works. Since the authors usually don't have original ideas to write about, instead they want to express their love for a series by writing stories that could have happened, which is why you're often seeing these sexual situations in doujinshi. Sex is popular, and it is generally abstained from in source material. Thus writing about it is a good way to make your doujinshi popular easily, since many people will have had similar thoughts while reading the source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as if there are doujinshi that do not involve sexual situations, the answer is of course. Since we are talking about self-published works, there is really no limit to what kind of stories you could find, just like in any fan fiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, your question about finding out what is in them ahead of time, has already been asked here: &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/25708/how-do-i-figure-out-the-contents-of-doujinshi"&gt;How do I figure out the contents of doujinshi?&lt;/a&gt; While there isn't an answer to that question posted, it seems the consensus from the comments is that outside of learning about the contents from a doujin circle, it is rather hard to know what to expect. &lt;/p&gt;

However, they seem to have a different patch that exhibits two crossed swords.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So far in the anime (up to episode 12), from these three we've seen (if I didn't miss any) only the Stationary Guard's patch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most likely wrong, as we'd seen Levi before, and he belongs to the Scouting Legion. See this image from episode 13:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SclpQ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SclpQm.jpg" alt="Levi and the Scouting Legion&amp;#39;s patch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In episode 13, we also see the Military Police's patch, although from a distance:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xPnt.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xPntm.jpg" alt="Guards standing, with the Military Police patch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;The patch is visible on the arms of the guards standing by the cell&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we've seen all three patches (Scouting Legion, Military Police and Stationary Guard), plus the Crossed-Swords patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my misunderstanding came from the fact that the characters I mentioned in the question are listed in the &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Wiki" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Shingeki no Kyojin Wiki&lt;/a&gt; as affiliated either with the Scouting Legion (&lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Eren_Yeager" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Eren Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Mikasa_Ackerman" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Mikasa Ackerman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Armin_Arlelt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Armin Arlert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Jean_Kirschtein" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jean Kirschtein&lt;/a&gt;) or the Military Police (&lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Annie_Leonhardt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Annie Leonhardt&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
However, episode 13 also shed some light on this matter, when Jean identified &lt;a href="http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Marco_Bodt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Marco Bodt&lt;/a&gt; as "The 104th Training Corps Leader of Squad 19, Marco Bodt."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ASA4r.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ASA4rm.jpg" alt="Marco Bodt&amp;#39;s corpse"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on episode 13, Levi tells Eren he'll accept his application to the Scouting Legion:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RE5U0.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RE5U0m.jpg" alt="Levi telling Eren he&amp;#39;ll accept him in the Scouting Legion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The Scouting Legion is dubbed/subbed as Recon Corps in the anime&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would mean that the characters mentioned in the question still belonged to the Training Corps, and that the affiliation mentioned in their SnK Wiki pages (which, in addition to the fact that I was under the impression they had already "graduated" from the Training Corps, caused my misunderstanding) is, presumably, from the manga, which is ahead in the plot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basically, &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4196/was-the-scouting-legions-patch-or-the-characters-military-affiliation-changed#comment3437_4196"&gt;as JonLin wrote in the comment below the question&lt;/a&gt;, the Crossed-Swords patch belongs to the Training Corps, and no affiliation seems to have been changed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="36373" Title="red-haired crew, no devil fruit, still really strong?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I've heard on many online forums that the red haired crew is the only crew with &lt;strong&gt;all Human Pirates&lt;/strong&gt;. What exactly is that makes the crew so exceptionally strong and the captain -&lt;em&gt;Shanks&lt;/em&gt;- being one of the four emperors.&lt;br&gt;&#10;They've been portrayed really strong, in the Marine ford arc, several admirals also Blackbeard and his crew were afraid of fighting them, Admiral Kizaru -&lt;em&gt;who also seems really strong&lt;/em&gt;- was shut down just by a look from Ben Beckman.&lt;br&gt;&#10;What exactly is their extent of powers being &lt;em&gt;normal human being&lt;/em&gt; and have they shown it in any episodes?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36375">&lt;p&gt;Right now we know very little about their abilities.  We do not know whether they have any Devil Fruits. Even Shanks, who we know did not have a devil fruit when he lost his arm, could have eaten one more recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said many strong characters don't have devil fruits.  Silvers stopped Kizaru and was shown swimming later. The majority of the Strawhats still do not have Devil Fruits including 2 of the 3 strongest fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haki (and possibly Sea Stone) seems to allow non-Devil Fruit users to fight evenly with Devil Fruit users. Shanks has been shown to have incredibly powerful Conqueror's Haki to the extent that he damaged Whitebeard's ship with no visible effort or action.  It is likely several others (especially those who halted admirals) have Haki too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that Ben Beckman is the smartest person to come from the East Blue which puts him above both Nami and Captain Kuro (man of 1000 plans). Yassop is a powerful sniper like Ussop (who is more skilled that a platoon of WG soldiers despite appearances).  Rockstar had a bounty of 94,000,000 Beri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We literally only know the names of 5 of Shank's crew (the above and Lucky Roo) though we have seen several more.  There is no telling what insane abilities each member of the crew might have when we know so little.  The few we do know were able to at least intimidate marine admirals.  There is more out of universe (fan theory really) evidence that one day Sanji will confront Kizaru and Zoro will confront Fujitora. I don't think anyone would doubt that they are powerful crew mates and will likely never rely on devil fruit powers.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="44732" Title="Why Doflamingo chose Dressrosa?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Doflamingo said he is back to his old kingdom. Why did he said that and what was the point of choosing Dressrosa as his kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44733">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donquixote_Family" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Donquixote Family&lt;/a&gt; ruled Dressrosa 800 years ago. Here is the  &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donquixote_Family" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; article for that:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Donquixote Family is a royal bloodline which ruled the Dressrosa Kingdom eight hundred years ago and one of the twenty royal families which founded the World Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is reason for him saying that he is back to his own kingdom as his ancestors were the original rulers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were replaced by Riku Family when they shifted to Marijois. Here is the &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donquixote_Family" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; article for that:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dressrosa was one of the 20 Kingdoms that fought the Great Kingdom. The Donquixote family originally ruled Dressrosa but the family moved to Mariejois and were replaced by the Riku Family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doflamingo was a World Noble when he was born but his Father left that position when Doflamingo was young. Here is the &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donquixote_Family" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Forty-one years ago, the child Donquixote Doflamingo was born in the noble bloodline, and two years after, the second child Rosinante was born. After enjoying eight short years of the Celestial Dragons' privileged lifestyle, Doflamingo was evicted from such luxuries when his father, Donquixote Homing, abdicated their status as World Nobles in order to live a normal life with his family of four; Homing was always considered by his compatriots as blasphemous and disgrace to the title of World Nobles. However, Doflamingo was still clinging onto his heritage by asking his father to buy more slaves and demand subservience from commoners, an attitude that Homing intended to reform.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The family took residence in a country in the North Blue, which has no ties to the World Government. As a last favor, the Government has prepared an adequate manor and financial assets for the family to live with. Although Homing wished for a humble and peaceful life with his family among humanity, away from Mariejois' spoiling nature, little did he knew at the time that the island they resided on was filled with people who bear deep grudges against the Celestial Dragons, which would, in the future, become a stepping stone to Doflamingo's descend to darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Shortly after taking residence in the country, when it became known that the Donquixote Family are former World Nobles, their manor was burned to the ground by angry victims of the Celestial Dragons, and the family was forced to hideout in a small shack in the junkyard, much to Doflamingo's disgust. Barely escaping from constant pursuit, Homing tried to contact Mariejois to save his sons and wife, but the Celestial Dragons retorted how the family cannot return from their choices and coldly hung up. Consequently, the family was stuck living in poverty and on the run, and the two children were beaten up when they tried to steal food; they resorted to eating out of trash bins, and though they brought some food for their mother, she died from illness brought by the deplorable household, much to her family's broken hearts. Eventually, the three remaining Donquixote Family members were found and caught, and then hanged onto a wall above flames, tortured and beaten. While Homing and Rosinante were screaming for mercy, Doflamingo viciously blamed his father for condemning the family to such a hellish life, and snarlingly swore to kill all the commoners in revenge, turning the citizens' hatred to horrified shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doflamingo killed his own Father for doing this. Here is the &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donquixote_Family" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; article for that:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two years later, Doflamingo's suffering drove him over the edge, awakening his Haoshoku Haki, knocking out the citizens. Trebol, a knowledgeable 18-years old, saw this as the advent of his new king, gifted Doflamingo with a Devil Fruit and an ornate flintlock. Armed with a viable weapon, Doflamingo killed his own father, for whom he holds with contempt for condemning the family into the life of outcasts. The child then took his father's head back to Mariejois, hoping to return to the privileged life as a Celestial Dragon. Unfortunately for him, the World Nobles already considers the Donquixote Family as a "family of traitors" for fraternizing with commoners, and refused to let him return. However, armed with the knowledge of Mariejois' national treasure, Doflamingo was considered a threat and the World Nobles tried to kill him; they failed and the former Celestial Dragon escaped.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Doflamingo became a pirate with the goal of revenge against the World Nobles who refused to reinstate his status by destroying the world they lord over, and he gathered various recruits whom became a new incarnation of the "Donquixote Family", whom he saw as his new, treasured family.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Wolf's Rain&lt;/strong&gt; anime, the goal of all the wolves is to reach a vague, nebulous goal called &quot;Paradise&quot;. While there's a bunch of descriptions about what it looks like or where it is, what exactly is &quot;Paradise&quot;? Did they reach it at the end of the series? Was it just a pre-programmed, innate goal that's implanted that doesn't really exist?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3067">&lt;p&gt;Paradise seems to be largely related to many religions' interpretation of Paradise, &lt;em&gt;a place in which existence is positive, harmonious and timeless&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[Wikipedia]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wolves' Paradise is a place which, to them, is a final goal they wish to reach, and appears to be very closely linked to them. As one prophecy reads, &lt;em&gt;"When the world ends, Paradise will open, but only the wolves know how to find it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://wolfsrain.wikia.com/wiki/Paradise" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Wolf's Rain&lt;/em&gt; Wiki]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, it is speculated that Paradise is a place which cannot be found, but must be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The goal of opening Paradise is achieved at the end of the series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cheza is the one who will lead the wolves to paradise, but in the final episode her death opens it, as the seeds that created her spill out and sprout when rain falls. In the same episode, Paradise is seen as a beautiful meadow filled with Lunar Flowers. However, after a short time, Lord Darcia's cursed wolf eye poisons Paradise, seen as a dark fluid leaking out of the eye and the white centre of the flowers darkening. The wolves never enter this paradise, instead being seen as true humans at a modern city. What can be concluded is that Paradise cannot be found, but it can be built.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://wolfsrain.wikia.com/wiki/Paradise" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Wolf's Rain&lt;/em&gt; Wiki]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dxxRc.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="7296" Title="Why was a prequel made instead of an adaptation for Ga-Rei?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the Ga-Rei Zero anime and the Ga-Rei manga (now finished) quite a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the anime industry seemingly grasping at straws for manga to adapt, why was a prequel animated instead of the actual source material?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7356">&lt;p&gt;Ga-Rei: Zero was released in 2008-10-05. If the marketing and industry people want to work on a 6 month lead time, this puts decision time at 2008-4-01. At that time, the most recent tank&#333;bon release was volume 5 back in 2007-10-26. Also, the mangaka took longer to publish material as the series progressed. See below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1   05/26/06    days
2   07/26/06    61
3   11/25/06    122
4   04/26/07    152
5   10/26/07    183
6   04/26/08    183
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the manga was popular and they wanted to get that target audience but didn't have a lot confidence in how the current story arc which was still being written would adapt to a 13 episode series they decided to hijack the plot and audience and make their own version of it. It's just speculation though. I did like this series. The first episode had me totally lost after having read the manga though :/&lt;/p&gt;

Shouldn't it be with the stealth force or even Yoruichi's possession? Better yet, since it is able to destroy the Sokyoku, why is it entrusted to another captain rather than Head Captain Yamamoto?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46644">&lt;p&gt;I know this is old, and I don't know if anyone thought of that before, but what if there were two conspiracies ongoing at the same time during that arc? The first one, of course, Aizen's, and the second one involving Ukitake, Kyoraku and Yoruichi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it, what the hell was Yoruichi doing in Soul Society before training Ichigo? I think that she went to Ukitake and Kyoraku and let them in on the plan to stop Rukia's execution. This involved Yoruichi going to her clan's arsenal where she got the shield, and Ichigo's flying cape. She gave Ukitake the shield (how else could he get his hands on a powerful Shihoin artifact like that?). My guess is that Ukitake was on board with it from the beginning, but Kyokaru was on the fence, hence why he was still not sure of what to do hours before the execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even Unohana was on board with it because once the execution was stopped by Ichigo, Yoruichi, Ukitake and Shunsui, she leaves and goes to Central 46 where Aizen is. I'm not saying she knew about it, but perhaps Ukitake and Yoruichi also contacted her, noticing how odd Central 46 had been behaving. For instance, that type of execution was reserved to captains, yet they decided to use it on Rukia, despite her not even being a lieutenant. Not only that, but they also ordered the execution to happen sooner, and denied Ukitake's request to cancel the execution, all giving credit to Yoruichi's story.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Often in anime which features a character who wears glasses, when they take off their glasses, their eyes turn into a sort of puckered lip emoticon that looks like the number 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/S0JDv.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The meaning is fairly obvious, that the character looks drastically different or worse without their glasses on. But why is this icon used, specifically?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21863">&lt;p&gt;The "3" is a stylized (and humorous) way of showing the characters squinting their eyes, which then look somewhat like a "3".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most glasses wearer &amp;mdash; especially the young ones &amp;mdash; are short-sighted, so whenever they take off their glasses, they start squinting. The "3" is used in a similar fashion to depict pouting characters, like with the following emoji:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&#176;3&#176;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variation of this is the famous &#12408;&#12398;&#12408;&#12398;&#12418;&#12408;&#12376; (henohenomoheji), which uses Hiragana characters that look somewhat like facial features and is used almost exclusively for humorous purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From the Doraemon Wikia:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Nobita's eyes are never drawn consistently. Sometimes they look like the number 3, sometimes they're black beaded, and sometimes, like in the case of the recent movies, they're normal eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I was really curious so I wanted to know: How much sales of anime in Japan is considered profitable? By sales I mean the DVD or something like that.&#10;I heard that anime season or continuation is based on the sales in Japan so, any guess?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="51098">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That depends and the answer will vary per anime because the cost of making one season of anime varies&lt;/em&gt;. However, from &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-08-13/anime-insiders-share-how-much-producing-a-season-costs/.91536" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Masamune Sakaki, a CG creator in the anime industry, an average 13-episode anime season costs around 250 million yen (or $2 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take that as an example and say that each Blu-ray would cost at around 5000 yen, which is more or less the case if you look at &lt;a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;some sites selling them&lt;/a&gt;, the anime would have to sell at around 50000 Blu-rays for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break-even" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;break-even&lt;/a&gt;, and even more for profit and a budget for another season. This is only if they're trying to recover costs based on Blu-ray sales alone, but anime tend to have other merchandise you can buy aside from Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;When Kaoruko and Azuma awaken all the Buranki on Treasure Island in episode 1, they cause some of the Buranki to fall to Earth. Eight Buranki fall on Tokyo (according to contemporaneous news reports seen at the beginning of episode 3, and according to Hiiragi later that episode), not counting Oubu. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, as Oubu falls to Earth (with Kaoruko, Azuma, and their father inside), we get this aerial shot of the Tokyo area:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/llVy2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/llVy2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;episode 1, 10:29&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are some smoke plumes, all located on the west side of the bay. I've marked them with red dots in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOwhp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wOwhp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are only seven plumes, though. Where did the eighth Buranki fall? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="37813">&lt;p&gt;The news reports at around 1:00 into episode 3 state that there are reports of Buranki having fallen in Ohta, Toshima, Chiyoda, Shinjuku, and Sumida wards. We also see footage of a destroyed Buranki in Bunkyo ward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I've superimposed a diagram of the wards of Tokyo over the screenshot in the question (which is thankfully fairly easy to do because of the distinctive shape of Tokyo Bay). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dzzds.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dzzds.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In green, I've outlined Sumida. A Buranki is supposed to have fallen there, but there's no smoke plume. The other wards listed all have smoke plumes in theme, so my best guess is that someone just forgot to draw a plume in Sumida. &lt;/p&gt;

Is this used in other films or series?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2962">&lt;p&gt;Those are good old hand-drawn backgrounds. Here's a part of &lt;a href="http://www.ghibliworld.com/suzuki_toshio_interview.html"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Suzuki Toshio, executive producer and former president of Studio Ghibli (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During this decade CG &lt;em&gt;[computer graphics, - singerofthefall]&lt;/em&gt; came up and we realized that it enables us to
  make expressions richer when using it as supplement of regular cel &lt;em&gt;[sic!]&lt;/em&gt;
  animation. On the other hand a new problem appeared. The progress of
  computing tech is so fast that it isn't easy to catch up. If a movie
  at one point is made by the highest tech, it will become outdated
  soon. There is one more point. We tried CG on Howl&#8217;s. For example, the
  legs of the castle were made by CG. However, it didn't seem very
  natural to me and I told Miyazaki that his skill was better than that
  of a computer. He accepted it and quit using CG after that. Hence the
  latter half of Howl&#8217;s doesn't include any CG. We now know CG has both
  its plus and minus sides. So the theme of this movie is as the story:
  simple. The visual effects are simple as well, while on the other hand
  &lt;strong&gt;it needs very hard working because of the drawing all it by hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/aug/14/us-film-hayao-miyazaki-081409/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Miyazaki, whose films include "Princess Mononoke," "Howl's Moving
  Castle" and "My Neighbor Totoro," has used computer animation to
  embellish hand-drawn images. But before "Ponyo" went into production,
  &lt;strong&gt;he shut down the computer-graphics department at his Studio Ghibli,
  opting to work solely in hand-drawn images.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, from &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6911264/Hayao-Miyazaki-drawn-to-perfection.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He insisted he still uses a pencil to draw his animated characters and
  backgrounds: &#8220;Currently computer graphics are used a great deal,&#8221; he
  noted, &#8220;but it can be excessive. I think [animation] needs the pencil,
  needs man&#8217;s hands drawing.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend you to check some of Makoto Shinkai's works (if you haven't seen them before) the quality of the animation and backgrounds there is stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:
There is an artbook called "The Art of Ponyo", which contains sketches hand-drawn by Miyazaki. I don't own it, but you can take a look at it's reviews &lt;a href="http://www.parkablogs.com/content/book-review-art-of-ponyo-cliff-sea"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cdn.halcyonrealms.com/animation/the-art-of-ponyo-part-i-storyboards/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cdn.halcyonrealms.com/anime/the-art-of-ponyo-part-ii-concept-and-background-art/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The book includes both pencil and watercolor drawings, including characters, backgrounds, etc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Usually I use poster paint to create the backgrounds; then I color the
  base in a pale color, adding subtle hues and shading on top of it.
  This time, with Ponyo, I added things like tints or detailed
  expressions with colored pencil on top of what I drew with poster
  paint...&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Gluttony is said to be a fake Gate of Truth, as shown by when he swallows Ed and Ling. They are transported to a place that is full of blood, which seems to be entirely different from the place where the real Gate of Truth takes someone. What does him being a fake Gate of Truth mean, as opposed to just being some sort of transportation device? What is the difference between his Gate of Truth and the real one?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4941">&lt;p&gt;Gluttony was created for the sole purpose of being a portal of Truth. Father was attempting to create a way to access the so-called "non-reality" (beyond the Gate) without paying a toll; essentially, he wanted to entirely bypass Truth so that he could access &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4938/274"&gt;all alchemical knowledge within the Gate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNwjA.png" alt="&amp;quot;Gluttony is the result of Father&amp;#39;s unsuccessful attempt at recreating the Gate of Truth.&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Father is not omnipotent; he was unable to create a portal which was able to do what he hoped for. Instead, what you see of Gluttony was the result: A portal, attached to a homunculus, that serves as a gateway to a different world, one that is neither reality nor non-reality (that is, it is somewhere between the universe and the realm of Truth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/640dl.png" alt="&amp;quot;I guess it&amp;#39;s safe to call this place the crevice between reality and the truth.&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably goes without saying at this point that the difference between this Gate and the real one is that, well, this one is useless. Basically, it's just &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2336/274"&gt;its own dimension&lt;/a&gt; that serves as nothing but a place for Gluttony's consumptions to go. It contains no alchemical knowledge, no God (which would be in the real Gate), and no way out.&lt;/p&gt;

This marks the bad start of the love story between them.&lt;/p&gt;

I also know that in the second game, Yuuna appears and tries to convince Sara to call Kaede &quot;Onee-sama&quot;, and in the third game she encouraged Mai to be honest with her feelings, saying that it feels good to be in love. But in neither of these does Yuuna hint that she's already in a relationship with Nanami, as in the first game Yuuna admits she fell in love with Nanami when they first met when Nanami was lost and was trying to get to the opening ceremony and that she has always wanted to be called Onee-sama.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also remember in one of the games, some of the characters mentioning the new student which I think is referencing Sara (though I can't remember which games).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="26703" Title="What is the name of the song at the start of K: Return of Kings?"

</answer></question><question Id="13266" Title="How does Tomoe's father know who kenshin is or that they were even married?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the manga Oibore in the fallen district (slums) ends up revealing who he is when asked why he helped Kenshin by telling the people there its his daughters husband who was there when she died.  But how did he know? Kenshin was a top secret assassin and his identity was kept secret to most of the public. How did he even know they got married (it happened in the mountains away from anyone) or Tomoe died while kenshin was there (the only people who would know, kenshin killed and maybe the higher up imperialists)?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was stated he abandoned the family after his wife died so he wouldn't have had any contact with her or Enishi.  Enishi doesn't even meet him until after his fight with Kenshin, even then it is implied he doesn't really know who he is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29985">&lt;p&gt;Tomoe knew that Kenshin was her fiance's assassin. She moved to Kyoto, desperate to find him. So we can assume that the rest of the family knew about Kenshin too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Kenshin kills, he delivers the "Tenshu", a signature for the crimes, that identifies the faction responsible for the murders. Kenshin's reputation among the Ishin Shishi and their ennemies was increasing (remember that the Shinsen Gumi has a physical description of him before actually meeting Kenshin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Mr Yukishiro knows that his daughter's fiance was killed by the Ishin Shishi's assassin, and later on, that assassin became famously known has a man with red hair and 2 scars across his left cheek. Even if Kenshin's name was unknown to most, his appearance and skill was becoming a legend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how would he know about Tomoe's wedding? She wrote to Enishi, once they moved close to Ootsu. That is why Enishi meets them in the mountain (and he already knows that Kenshin is responsible for her fiance's death). We can assume that Tomoe's father learnt about her wedding from Enishi.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth&lt;/em&gt; after Vert reveals that the Brothers are in the torture room all we see is that they are playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sure the younger brother apparently hates the games that much but how is this torture?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29406">&lt;p&gt;The games the Brother's were playing was BL games. BL is the acronym for &lt;em&gt;Boy's Love&lt;/em&gt; which is &lt;em&gt;Shounen Ai/Yaoi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yaoi (/&#712;ja&#650;i/, Japanese: [ja.o.i]), also known as Boys' Love (BL), is a Japanese genre of fictional media focusing on romantic or sexual relationships between male characters, typically aimed at a female audience and usually created by female authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia - Yaoi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brothers are Oppai Fanatics where in they idealize breasts to the point they &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they ignore "small chested" women unless they suddenly gorw much larger as is the case when Neptune enters HDD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they would betray their Goddess, Blanc, and worship Vert because she has a much larger chest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they would knowingly follow a fake Vert because she too has a large chest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing BL Games hit the Brothers in 2 weak points. firstly most men would be "flat chested" and BL games would have echii scenes of half naked men showing off their flat chests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly the Brothers are real ladies men as they did try and woo Compa and Vert in the beginning so seeing nothing but men would devoid them of women, particularly that it seems the older brother seemed to develop feeling that are more than familial to his younger bother&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="46390" Title="Can English people (American Writers) produce anime shows and write manga?" Body="&lt;p&gt;This question has been asked between me and my friends for centuries. We were trying to make tiny novels of manga and produce an anime show for the art club we own. Seems as it is their culture and their talent. Can we really make only English anime/manga and dub it to Japanese? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46391">&lt;p&gt;Yes. an example of this of an English Book becoming an anime is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltora_Quest_(series)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Deltora Quest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Deltora Quest series is the collective title for three distinct series of children's fantasy books, written by Australian author Emily Rodda. It follows the adventures of three companions as they journey across the fictitious land of Deltora, endeavoring to recover the seven gems stolen from the magical Belt of Deltora and defeat allies of the evil Shadow Lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;under &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltora_Quest_(series)#Adaptations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Adaptations&lt;/a&gt; it says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A 65 part Deltora Quest anime series of the first eight books began its broadcast season in Japan on January 6, 2007. Rodda chose this option because she and her kids "love Japanese anime, and want any adaptation of Deltora to be cool".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is backed up by it being on the anime's entry &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltora_Quest_(anime)#Production" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;on Wikipedia under Production&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The series was produced by Genco and the animation production at OLM and SKY Perfect Well Think. Rodda was originally approached with many film offers, but it was only this studio that promised to not change the story. The first episode was aired on January 6, 2007 in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Deltora Quest was originally licensed in North America by Geneon as one of their final licenses, but shut down before doing anything with the series. The series was then rescued by Dentsu's newly established North American branch, and they produced an English version of the series in association with Ocean Productions in Vancouver, British Columbia and recorded at their Calgary-based Blue Water Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and since the anime only started being aired in the west in May 2010 this is an instance of an english written book being made into a japanese anime. while not American Emily Rodda is Australian and thus English&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however making an "english anime" and dubbing it in japanese we have 2 close examples to this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The series is presented in a style that combines anime with American cartoons and relies on the imagery of East-and-South Asian, Inuit, and New World societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however i don't know if it was ever subbed in Japan, though if not the possibility that it could be exists as Japan does localize western movies like &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; (it all depends on the licensing). i included this because fan still debate if this is anime or not where it was created in english&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a better example however is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RWBY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RWBY (/&#712;ru&#720;bi/, like "ruby") is an American anime-style web series and media franchise created by Monty Oum for Rooster Teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unlike &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; we know it's been localized in Japan having been dubbed in Japanese&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The series has also been dubbed in Japan and broadcast by Tokyo MX, in partnership with Warner Bros. Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also it's spawned &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY#Manga" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;a manga&lt;/a&gt; too which unlike &lt;em&gt;Avatar's&lt;/em&gt; comics, was produced in Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The November 2015 issue of Shueisha's Ultra Jump magazine announced that Dogs manga author Shirow Miwa would be illustrating a manga adaptation of RWBY, which debuted in the December 2015 issue on November 19, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/46390/can-english-people-american-writers-produce-anime-shows-and-write-manga#comment60502_46390"&gt;as &#1082;&#1103;&#945;z&#1108;&#1103; pointed out&lt;/a&gt; this is rare. aside from the costs of the license to reproduce and distribute dubbing also increases the costs over subbing because of hiring Seiyuu and as we see with &lt;em&gt;RWBY&lt;/em&gt; it had the backing of major companies like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers_Japan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wanner Brothers&lt;/a&gt; who do operate in Japan to (you'll see alot of Disney stuff gets localized because &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animation_studios_owned_by_The_Walt_Disney_Company#Disney_Animation_Japan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Disney operates in Japan too&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however, just like &#1082;&#1103;&#945;z&#1108;&#1103; said there is always the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Djinshi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;doujinshi&lt;/a&gt; route. admittedly in the west (to my knowledge) it's not entirely the same where there are large conventions centered around presenting and selling doujinshi however as doujinshi (manga and light novel wise) are really just self-published work and self-publishing books has been made easier&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with the internet and digital distribution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1: some publishers like Amazon which facilitated self-published works have been trying to regain the control traditional publishes had since with self-publishing, traditional publishers doesn't have nearly as much control over gaining profits and intellectual propriety rights as they used to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hope this helps&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35763">&lt;p&gt;I found this interesting and helpful tidbit of info from &lt;a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/archive/index.php/t-73298.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;an old PokeCommunity forum thread&lt;/a&gt;. It's not conclusive, but it is explanatory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think of it as like Charmeleon was like a teenager. It had paid
  attention to Ash when it was young and naive, because it Ash showed it
  caring and love. However, when it got older, and learned more, it
  became cocky and saw Ash for what he was-- a rookie trainer that was
  still learning many of the basics. I think Charmeleon felt as if he
  didn't have any respect for Ash. When he started listening to Ash in
  the Orange Islands, it was after he saw how dedicated and serious Ash
  could be, even to something that was repeatedly rude and menacing to
  him. I think that when Charizard saw Ash doing that, he began to have
  some respect and admiration for the boy.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Charizard may have been a 'plot device' to show pokemon that disobey,
  but it was important because it showed that not even Ash could 'wow'
  every pokemon with a couple days of friendship. It also was an
  indication of Ash maturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's another interesting viewpoint from &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Charmeleon-and-Charizard-obey-Ash-in-Pok%C3%A9mon-Indigo-League" rel="noreferrer"&gt;an old question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since Charmander was once rejected as weak he had gained an
  inferiority complex. He was always trying to prove himself. When he
  evolve into Charmeleon, he lost his fear and considering itself as
  proud. He gained self-pride and was considering itself as strong
  pokemon. Thus he was arrogant, and didn't listened Ash's orders. Later
  it evolved into a Charizard to prove its strength in front of a
  Aerodactyl. Charizard retained his disobedience to Ash as of
  Charmeleon. However, when Ash saved him after being frozen by Tad's
  Poliwrath's Ice Beam, Charizard's loyalty to Ash returned in full
  force; the best part of Charmander's pre-evolved personality was back.
  So the arrogance and disobedience that Charizard (or Charmeleon) was
  beacause he was boastful of his immense power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42510">&lt;p&gt;Charmander was Damien's Pokemon first. Ash didn't catch a wild Charmander. True, Charmander was abandoned by Damien, but it was still loyal to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Ash didn't earn all of his badges fair and square. He got some because he defended gyms from Team Rocket. The anime badges don't make Pokemon obey, unlike the games.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the first set of opening credits for &lt;em&gt;Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai&lt;/em&gt; we see a short scene of Rascal wearing an unusual type of backpack in a way I have never seen before.&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdH22.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdH22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rascal from the back, wearing narrow, low backpack.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have only watched the first three episodes, and I don't believe there has been context for this picture presented. I've never seen such a narrow backpack before, but I'll assume they exist.  Several characteristics strike me as odd:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;By as low as it sits, it is as much as a &quot;butt pack&quot; as a backpack, at least as Rascal is wearing it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The upper straps are shown restricting his arms. Is he unnecessarily binding his arms, or is that the proper way to wear it?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the backpack were raised high enough for the upper straps to fit over his shoulders (common for most backpacks I believe), then the lower strap would seem to fit around his upper chest, which also seems unusual.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this a real world item being worn the way it is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49658">&lt;p&gt;I believe it's the same type of bag that the other students have, but he is wearing it on his back, wrapping his hands through the straps instead of holding it over his shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="8853" Title="Did Itachi know that Shisui had a Mangekyo Sharingan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Don't take me for a fool, I know the situation, but I've been watching the fight between Itachi and Sasuke, where he said something like this from the old times: &quot;Come after me, when you will obtain the same eyes as mine, being the third to hold a MS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He already had the Mangekyo Sharingan, so we can safely assume that he knew the story about his &quot;elders&quot;, hence knowing not just about Madara, but Izuna and of course Shisui too. Obviously, he didn't know about Obito/Kakashi, but is this a plot hole, or did Itachi really not know that along with Madara and himself, two others already possessed that kind of Sharingan, making his statement false, since Sasuke would've been at least the fifth person?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(I've written Shisui for purpose in the title, but we don't just have to talk about him.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8859">&lt;p&gt;It is not a plot hole. And he isn't necessarily wrong. He just meant the third person &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. Of course he knew about Shisui, he had his eye. Of course he knew about Izuna and Madara too since he introduced their story to Sasuke. And he probably knew about other unnamed Uchihas too, if there were any, because as he said the Uchihas were killing their best friends for decades to achieve it. So I can't find any other logical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8911">&lt;p&gt;I believe I understood your question a bit. I will try to elaborate on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check out the episode of the Nine Tails attacking the Leaf Village, you must have noticed different age groups of various characters. Kakashi, Gai, and Asuma were depicted as teenagers. There is even a clip where Itachi was holding the infant Sasuke on his lap, assuring him that he would always protect him. Itachi was around 10-11 years old. By this, I can conclude that &lt;strong&gt;Kakashi was an elder to Itachi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your question you stated that:-"Obviously, he[Itachi] didn't know about Obito/Kakashi",I would like to highlight something which could  contradict with your statement. Itachi &lt;strong&gt;did know&lt;/strong&gt; about Kakashi as he was a prodigy in his age. Getting Sharingan after Obito's death made him &lt;strong&gt;a source of attraction&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;By then, Obito was out of the picture completely [since everyone assumed him to be dead]&lt;/strong&gt;. At the beginning of the Shippuuden episodes, Itachi called Kakashi, "&lt;strong&gt;Copy Ninja&lt;/strong&gt;", while he fought against him. Now, coming to your question, Itachi couldn't figure out the man behind Tobi's mask. &lt;strong&gt;Because of his boastful nature and strong power&lt;/strong&gt;, Obito made Itachi believe that he was Madara. Obito's calling himself Madara depicts his deceptional and boastful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, I can say that there is no plot hole anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/2077/debal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;debal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said, both Kakashi and Itachi were in ANBU group.By this we can conclude that both knew each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it clearer we can list all current know Mangenkyo users and how they have or might have obtained it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itachi - It is thought he killed Shisui but did not. Very likely he witnessed Shisui's death. I can think of one scenario but it's just a speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Itachi saw Shisui for the last time, he had MS activated. I think Shisui used Kotoamatsukami on Itachi and made Itachi to kill Shisui. Itachi can't remember it, 'cause Shisui used Kotoamatsukami, so the victim isn't aware that they're being controlled. That way Itachi got his MS and Shisui wanted him to protect Konoha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shisui - Unknown. But seems unlikely he murdered anyone as he showed a great deal of self sacrifice do kill himself rather than have his eyes fall into the wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sasuke - Did kill Itachi and he witnessed his death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kakashi - Got his MS after killing Rin;although he came to know about his Mangekyou at later stages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obito - Saw Kakashi killing Rin;which triggered his MS&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="30661">&lt;p&gt;I myself think that the third person could have been &lt;strong&gt;Madara&lt;/strong&gt;. Now Itachi had met Madara once or twice and Itachi was very wise. He paid attention to the things the others rarely did, said by the third Hokage when he was revived by Orochimaru. Also, he knew that Madara was the first one to awaken the Mangekyo Sharingan Izuna. He told that to Sasuke in Naruto Shippuden episode 136 or 137.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: now we know that masked man was Obito and the real Madara was dead but &lt;em&gt;Itachi&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;didn't at that time&lt;/em&gt;. Wise as Itachi was as a planner, &lt;strong&gt;Madara&lt;/strong&gt; was better than him and Madara told Obito that he has to live with the alias 'Madara Uchiha'. As for the people who are saying he knew about Kakashi having the Mangekyo, Kakashi rarely showed his Sharingan. Itachi and Kakashi were also not that close to each other. If I remember correctly, he said you will be the third one alive to have it. Shisui and Izuna were dead and he didn't know about Kakashi's so it would have been Madara.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38956">&lt;p&gt;This is false. What Itachi says because in The Itachi Story Arc we learn that Fugaku Uchiha, his father, possesses the mangekyou sharing and shows Itachi. Also Itachi tells Sasuke the story of the Izanami when he is reanimated and mentions the existence of many other Uchihas who possessed the mangekyou. Therefore, it must be a plot hole.&lt;/p&gt;

If so does, Android 16 have ki since he is fully mechanical and only living beings have ki?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31774">&lt;p&gt;Just watched the first few episodes of Dragon Ball Z Kai with the androids yesterday: they say that the living people like Goku and Vegeta can't detect any ki from the androids (also see &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Android_19" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Android_19&lt;/a&gt;), and that includes both 19 and 20 who absorb ki from people (although anime says "energy" never "ki"). Also, 20 has Dr. Gero's brain, so some part of him is alive I guess, but also isn't detected as ki when people are searching for him in the rocky hills after 19 is defeated. So, must not be ki.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34206">&lt;p&gt;I'd like to believe she has Ki, because she is part human.  At the world tournament Goku asks how her and Krillin had a child together and he explains that she was human to begin with and turned into an android by Dr. Gero.
(Season 7 episode 208 or 209)(I can't remember exactly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The correct term is Cyborg. Human with cybernetic parts, she was human by birth and turned into a cyborg, thus retaining certain human functionality, such as being able to get pregnant."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that still raises the question why Goku and the others couldn't detect their energy. I guess some things should just be left unasked?&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35740">&lt;p&gt;Though I have to look it back up, a major thing is that their source of power was physical generators in their bodies. I recall there were even claims that they had unlimited power thanks to these generators. This is likely the source of their actual power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why they are undetectable, there is a simple but fairly theoretical explanation for that. Scouters and the Z warriors general ability to sense power is not full proof, and in fact they work about the same. The Z warriors specifically learned how to suppress their power, which throws the sensing methods off, even to a point where scouters could not detect Gohan and Krillin on Namek. In a way, you could say they are leaking power, and that leaking of power is what is detectable. By actively containing it, it can't be detected. Androids have a purely mechanical method of generating power. It is completely feasible that because it is mechanical, instead of biological, it does not leak power, hence there is no surplus of power around them to detect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that way, all the androids do have some kind of Ki (as it can be used in the same way as Ki), and is undetectable for the same reason that Scouters were ineffective against the Z warriors on Namek. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44110">&lt;p&gt;16 does not have ki, hence he uses laser eyes and arm cannons. 17 and 18 do, that is why they are able to use ki blasts. Just look at how 18 learned destructo disc. It's really simple, they use the suppression technique so the Z Warriors wouldn't sense them.&lt;/p&gt;

Arlong got defeated by Luffy, he wasn't killed. Luffy didn't stay in Kokoyashi village either. So Arlong could have returned to his usual business of enslaving the village. He would have faced ugly humiliating words from Villagers initially, but why would it matter? All you gotta do is gang-up on them. No one in the village was strong enough to stop them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are many other pirates who just disappeared after being defeated. It's not like they lived their life with principle or something, they were bad guys who used to loot, cheat, and kill people. Why wouldn't they continue that after being defeated?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="30295">&lt;p&gt;In most of the cases, the big villains we've seen have been arrested by the Marines after they were defeated, so they would not get such an opportunity.

</answer><answer Id="30297">&lt;p&gt;it might be because, if pirate defeat another one usually that village will be under control of the winner, for example white beard had alot of villages under his control and no body ever touch them, because other pirates knows that if any thing happened in that village, it will cause them a lot of troubles with white beard and might start a war if the to side are strong.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="30304">&lt;p&gt;I must admit I do agree with both of the other 2 answers, however i think there is also a simple logical approach to the issue; with each successive antagonist luffy takes on the antagonists get stronger and stronger and so do the protagonists. Some of the antagonists are important and come back into play later on and some of them had 1 purpose, to be the next stepping stone for the straw hats to overcome and once they played that role they have no more use. Also who knows, maybe Arlong rules once again and straw hat is too busy fighting warlords and emperors to even know that Arlong is back in power. Whitebeard kept his islands safe because the threat of his crew hunting down enemies and destroying them but the straw hats are too busy progressing toward One Piece to keep tabs on those they defeat. Even if Arlong is back in power as long as he doesn't chase after Luffy then Luffy and his crew wont find out for years and years as they search for One Piece. &lt;/p&gt;

Is it an acronym or an abbreviation?&lt;br&gt;&#10;Or is it supposed to be some other thing?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="32361">&lt;p&gt;The word is likely to be an abbreviation for Wizard (&#12454;&#12451;&#12470;&#12540;&#12489;), but there is a bit of allusion behind the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a tricky one to explain and requires a bit of exploration into the Japanese language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists &lt;a href="http://kotowaza-allguide.com/u/udonotaiboku.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;an expression&lt;/a&gt; there, "&lt;a href="http://kakuyasu-eigo.com/greattreesaregoodfor/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&#12358;&#12393;&#12398;&#22823;&#26408;&lt;/a&gt;:" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Great trees are good for nothing but shade."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&#22823;&#12365;&#12394;&#26408;&#12293;&#12399;&#12289;&#26085;&#38512;&#20197;&#22806;&#12395;&#12399;&#24441;&#12395;&#12383;&#12383;&#12394;&#12356;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This refers to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aralia_cordata" rel="nofollow"&gt;Japanese spikenard (known as &#29420;&#27963;, "udo"), or "mountain asparagus,"&lt;/a&gt; referring to how the older, larger plant being of no use, except when it is young (and tender), where it is typically &lt;a href="https://scottishforestgarden.wordpress.com/2014/07/09/growing-and-eating-udo-aralia-cordata/" rel="nofollow"&gt;used for consumption&lt;/a&gt; in cuisine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's likely that the creator used the expression to allude to the state of Wizards in the series' universe, useless (good for nothing) fellows (as mentioned by certain character within the series). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is speculation that there might be even more uses of allusion, but there are no solid sources to corroborate it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#12458;&#12474; (o-zu, as in &lt;em&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;) &#8594; &#12458;&#12485; (o-du, or o-zu, depending on romanization) &#8594; &#12454;&#12489; (u-do, translated as "Wud")&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Naruto, by the end of Shippuden (ignoring the epilogue), neither Naruto nor Sasuke had ever passed the chunin exams. Given that the chunin exams seem to be held sporadically (two years between the ones in Naruto Part 1 and the ones being shown in the anime currently), it seems possible that other genin would end up in this situation. Is it possible for those genin to go directly to being jonin, or do they have to wait for possibly dozens of years (depending on how sporadically the chunin exams are held) to become a chunin first?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="19381">&lt;p&gt;First of all, it's &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14990/how-does-one-become-a-jounin"&gt;not exactly known how a Chunin becomes Jonin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/J%C5%8Dnin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jonin&lt;/a&gt; article on Naruto wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The villagers may send their &lt;strong&gt;recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; for a j&#333;nin appointment. The Kage reads said recommendations and may consider &lt;strong&gt;appointing an individual a j&#333;nin if his or her qualities are recognised as adequate by enough people and himself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, there was mention of a J&#333;nin Exam in the anime's Kurama Clan Arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don't know what the requirements for this exam are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also seems that the article/series doesn't mention anything about the general requirements for becoming a Jonin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Jonin article, it is safe to assume that becoming a Jonin is matter of experience, reputation and most importantly, skill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is it possible for a Genin to become Jonin? Yes. Provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are highly talented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are respected and well-known in his/her village.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have high level of experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have unique skill set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whether to become a Jonin also depends on personal beliefs of the person. As we can see from the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Genin" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Genin&lt;/a&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kosuke Maruboshi, who is called the Eternal Genin (&#19975;&#24180;&#19979;&#24525;, Mannen Genin) has the skills of a &lt;strong&gt;j&#333;nin-level&lt;/strong&gt; shinobi, but is officially a genin &#8212; a rank he had consciously decided to remain at, due to personal reasons. He shares the epithet with Might Duy, who in his twenty years as a genin mastered the Eight Gates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="19479">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Road to Ninja&lt;/strong&gt; movie, Naruto tried to get a recommendation from Iruka for promotion to J&#333;nin, but was refused.  Iruka said that Naruto had to become a Ch&#363;nin before he could become a J&#333;nin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Iruka: so, what did you want to talk about?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Naruto: Um, Iruka-sensei, uh, listen, you think you can submit a Jonin application for me?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Iruka: What?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Naruto: It's just that all of my other classmates are going to have their parents fill out applications for them, and, well, I, uh...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Iruka: Nope, sorry. I won't.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Naruto: But why not?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Iruka: &lt;strong&gt;Because that step is supposed to come after you become a chunin.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure you saved us from Pain, and everyone calls you the "Hero of the Hidden Leaf", but &lt;strong&gt;I can't give you special treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;  I mean, even your Dad worked his way up through the ranks - from Genin, to Chunin, to Jonin, to become Hokage. Then he went on to became a Hero.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Naruto: hmm, to become just a face carved into a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: In the Naruto Shippuden anime, &lt;strong&gt;Episode 413 - Hopes Entrusted to the Future&lt;/strong&gt; shows that it is possible for a Genin to be promoted to J&#333;nin under special circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee, Tenten, and Negi did not complete the original requirements of the second Ch&#363;nin Exam.  They returned with 2 "Heaven" scrolls instead of "Heaven" and "Earth" scrolls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lee: [places two heaven scrolls on the table] Please accept these.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Proctor: Two "Heaven" scrolls are not acceptable!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Lee: Oh, but that's--! [slaps table]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Proctor: No, no, no!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Lee: I can't reveal any details, but there were extraordinary circumstances that prevented us from collecting scrolls!  Please ask Lord Kazekage!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Proctor: It doesn't matter what circumstances there were. No means no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaara later rescinded that requirement when he cancelled the Third exam after he and F&#363; were attacked in an attempt to steal their tailed beasts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Temari: Cancel the Third exam?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Gaara: I'm sorry. I can't go into details, but this is a domestic matter within the Sand.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Shikamaru: Then how do we determine who passed the Chunin Exams?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Gaara: We've prepared detailed reports about each team's performance in the Second Exam.  &lt;strong&gt;I'd like the respective villages to use them to decide whether their participants should be promoted to chunin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[later, when addressing the exam participants...]&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Gaara: Therefore, I deem the Third Exam unnecessary... Furthermore, I am rescinding part of the requirements for the Second Exam... For each of you standing here right now, a detailed report of your performance will be sent to your respective villages.  &lt;strong&gt;Your Kage will make the final decision on your promotion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that report, Lady Tsunade "double-promotes" Negi to J&#333;nin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tsunade: I've gone over your Second Exam reports. And... Hinata, Shino, Kiba, Choji, Ino, and Sakura... You six passed with flying colors and are promoted to chunin!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Tsunade: [looking at Tenten, Negi, and Lee] Finally, although they did not collect two scrolls, they performed admirably... and are more than qualified for promotion.  Lee and Tenten, you are now chunin.&lt;/p&gt;

Surprisingly Heathcliff agrees. He then says, &quot;I'm positive you won't stay away from the battlefield for long.&quot; This clearly foreshadows he'll manipulate them into coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How did he do so?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53568">&lt;p&gt;Yui only appeared during a sidestory in the second light novel so we can say that she didn't play a role in their decision.&lt;br&gt;
Basically Heathcliff knew that Kirito and Asuna felt a responsibility for clearing the game seeing how they were some of the strongest players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Asuna then suddenly removed her smile and muttered:&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;Up until now, I had only fought on the upper floors. I had
  completely forgotten that there were people who lived normal lives&#8230;&#8221;&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re special; but since we&#8217;re on a high enough
  level to fight on the front lines, I suppose it also means that we have an
  obligation to them.&#8221;&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;&#8230;I had never thought about it like that&#8230; I always felt that
  becoming stronger was just a way to survive.&#8221;&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;I think that a lot of people are going to be counting on you from
  now on. Of course, that includes me.&#8221;&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;&#8230;except with my personality, hearing these kind of expectations
  only makes me want to run away.&#8221;&lt;br&gt;
  &#8220;Oh you.&#8221;&lt;br&gt;
  As Asuna pouted in dissatisfaction, I stroked her hair and hoped
  for this life to continue for a while longer. For Nishida and the other
  players, we have to return to the front lines at some point. But at least
  for now-&lt;br&gt;
  Based on the messages that Agil and Klein had sent me, I knew
  that they were having a hard time trying to clear the seventy-fifth floor.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That night, we received a message from Heathcliff, requesting us
  to take part in fighting the seventy-fifth floor boss.&lt;br&gt;

  Seeing as we had temporarily left the guild, we could decline the
  request. But the last line of the message, that &#8220;some people had already

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Z&lt;/em&gt;, Raditz is always seen wearing a red accessory band  both on his left arm and his left thigh. What are those for?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/27l9b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Symmetry&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4219">&lt;p&gt;AFAIK, there is (unfortunately) no official concensus on this matter. That aside, logic and speculation do help fill in some of the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Probable Answer(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They're meant for training/fighting.&lt;/strong&gt; - According to &lt;a href="http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-bicep-bands.htm"&gt;WiseGeek&lt;/a&gt;, bicep bands can be worn around the arm of someone doing physical activities to catch and absorb sweat. There has been rumors of how they keep constant pressure on tendons and thus would help keep in intact with the bone, thus preventing serious conditions such as tendonitis. Recent research, as the resource above states, has generally concluded against this, but during the time of Dragonball's production late 80's/early 90's, this would not have been known. Generally bands are not worn on the thigh, as he does, but again, since research had not been conducted, the writer may have just assumed it would have similar effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In addition to the this assumption, we could slightly speculate and say that they are similar technology, but enhanced in a way greater than our own world's limitations, but serve essentially the same purpose. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Speculative Answer(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are a symbol used by Saiyan Warriors&lt;/strong&gt; - The fan base enjoys looking for symbolism, and this is no exception. Many assume it indicates rank, or family. This assumption doesn't have much foundation though, since few, if any,  other Saiyan warriors are shown to use them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely they're just decoration, designed to enhance his appearance. I doubt Toriyama thought this out very deeply. :) &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="22952" Title="Why could Shirou use Rho Aias?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the UBW final battle, how come Shirou could use Rho Aias? Archer mentioned it was from the Trojan War (probably learned it while working as a counter force), but Shirou hadn't seen Rho Aias yet (not even when Archer used it).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="22956">&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://completematerial.pbworks.com/w/page/34267021/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;World Material FAQs&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;fate/complete material III&lt;/em&gt; with Nasu (p.130) reated to the VN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; In the end of the Rin route, was it Shirou that projected Rho Aias in the Shirou vs Gilgamesh fight? Or was it Archer? In Fate/side material, it's said that it was projection magic from Archer, but in the story, there was the depiction of Shirou "pulling the shield from the hill". Does this mean that this switched to Archer's scene?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This has been easy to misunderstand, but the part about Archer supporting Shirou was the time before Shirou pulled out Rho Aias, before Shirou came to his realization.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;After Shirou's monologue about his surprise that he was still alive after taking Gil's attack, "If I survived, there must have been a reason why I survived. But that was simply something I didn't have any control over."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;That was the "Rho Aias" that Archer made to help Shirou in a way that wouldn't let Gilgamesh know there was someone else waiting to ambush him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the first Rho Aias that defended him (as he was chanting UBW, it's difficult to project something like that at the same time) against Enuma Elish was project by Archer (EMIYA). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePQbb.jpg" alt="Rho Aias 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original has 7 petals, this one has 5 in the 2015 ufotable anime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDpCH.jpg" alt="Rho Aias 1a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one inside UBW was probably one copied from Archer's version (perhaps drawing from the experience that flowed into Shiro as they clashed). It's not clear how many petals was in this version (likely &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qU5F5.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;4 petals&lt;/a&gt;, like in the Heaven's Feel path). This part was never really clarified, but you can compare it to &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMC1k.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kuro's projection&lt;/a&gt; of it using the Archer Class Card from &lt;em&gt;Prisma Illya.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bwm0.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bwm0.gif" alt="Shirou&amp;#39;s projection in UBW"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that against Lancer, Archer had to muster almost all of his prana to project a &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TF495.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;7-petal version&lt;/a&gt;. Since he didn't have the prana for another 7-petal projection, he probably summoned a lesser projection in order to protect the Shirou and what reserves he had left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rho Aias not being a sword (being a shield), is going to cost more prana to summon. Since the UBW reality marble was not up, it's unlikely that Shirou had the means to to summon it at the time. So it's more likely that it came from an external entity (Archer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fate/side material&lt;/em&gt; encyclopedia on Rho Aias (&lt;a href="http://tmdict.com/book/fate-side-material#ro.rho-aias" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;p.78-79&lt;/a&gt;) states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Rho Aias that protected Shirou's spellcasting during the finale of the Rin route was not something he projected himself, but was actually made by Archer who was watching the battle from a distance.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirou mentioned that he was able to project it by pulling it out of the "hill of swords." This is likely a metaphor that refers to his reality marble (a materialization of one's inner self) or the collective of Archer memories, and not a literal hill.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31692">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;F/SN:UBW&lt;/em&gt; season 2, they revealed that Archer's true identity is Hero Emiya Shirou - the MC's future self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archer regrets that he became a hero, so he tried to kill the current Shirou (Archer's past self). When Archer used UBW to try to kill Shirou, the MC copied it using the 'trace-on' thingy so all the things inside the UBW was copied. I believe it includes the Rho Aias.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44263">&lt;p&gt;To give you a proper answer to this question, Archer stated during his battle with Shirou that he had heard of magecraft that allowed mastery of skills by invoking them from a previous life and letting them possess them, and that every time they crossed swords, Shirou's skill kept improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof to this theory would be when Archer next charges him and showed his past self, his future, and the path he'd be taking. That would explain how he learned to fight and use the Rho Aias.&lt;/p&gt;

and my best guess is that the authors killed off the parents to make his sister look for "motherly-like" and that they had a good bond, and so when she was in trouble, saving her (which is at episode 1) would be better.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20234">&lt;p&gt;Volume 3 of the Aldnoah.Zero Blu-rays came with a collection of four short narratives about Inaho and Yuki's life well prior to the events of episode 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second of them, &#12300;&#26149;&#12398;&#36960;&#36275;&#12301; "A Trip in Spring", we learn that Inaho, Yuki, and their mother had been on a train to somewhere when Heaven's Fall occurred. Their mother was killed immediately, probably because a meteor landed near their location (though the story is mostly told from Yuki's point of view, and she, being five-ish years old at the time, obviously doesn't have the best recollection of events). Somehow or the other, Inaho and Yuki both survive, and she, carrying Inaho, follows the crowd of evacuating people, eventually ending up in an underground shelter afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their father, a military man, was deployed at the time; a short while after Heaven's Fall, while Inaho and Yuki are still living in the shelter, Yuki receives a letter from the government indicating that they have been deemed war orphans. The implication being, of course, that their father, too, is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saazbaum hypothesis is clearly implausible.&lt;/p&gt;

Or is this supposed to be less shocking for the viewer or something similar?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4406">&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3447397"&gt;Something Awful playthrough thread&lt;/a&gt; for the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because of the intricacies of the Japanese game rating system, blood
  in this game is colored pink. Rest assured, though, it is human blood
  you will be looking at, and it doesn't mean our characters are
  secretly aliens or elves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganRonpa"&gt;TVTropes&lt;/a&gt; also says the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many murder scenes are liberally splattered in Pepto-Bismol, thanks to
  the intricacies of the Japanese game rating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems like making the blood realistic would have given the game a higher age rating, possibly restricting some of their target demographic from being able to purchase the game. But the pink blood also goes along with the main artistic style of Dangan Ronpa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangan_Ronpa#Development"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The game uses pop art, a bright and colorful style, as a way to
  contrast the dark subject matter of murder. Scenario writer Kazutaka
  Kodaka stated he desired to "...shake user's heart by showing a
  devastating accident in not devastating ways. But, by some measure, it
  might be more shocking than showing a devastating scene."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4407">&lt;p&gt;To add to atlantiza's answer, Danganronpa is rated D (17+) by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Entertainment_Rating_Organization"&gt;CERO&lt;/a&gt;, Japan's rating board for console video games. That's the highest rating which does not carry additional legal restrictions as to where and to whom you can sell it. Danganronpa is a console game, and it's very likely that the consoles would not have approved of it had it been rated Z (18+), but including red blood would have likely pushed it over this limit. Very few games rated Z ever get released, with the exception of a few violent games produced overseas where the ratings are less strict for violent content (e.g. in the U.S.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most visual novels are PC games, so they are rated by a different organization from CERO, namely EOCS. EOCS doesn't have the same restrictions against displaying red blood, but most of them are guaranteed an 18+ rating anyway for inclusion of sexual content. An 18+ rating from CERO has a much bigger impact in terms of sales than one from EOCS. It's not uncommon for Japanese console games to not include blood at all to avoid getting higher ratings, but Danganronpa obviously didn't have that option so they did the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why they kept the blood pink in the anime, it is sort of iconic at this point. The death scenes (so far) have all been very closely following the style of the game. Changing it would probably turn off fans, and the pink blood does fit well with the art style.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20412">&lt;p&gt;It's done so because when the human mind sees red blood it sets off a red flag in they're brain, but if it's a different color you don't get that reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44328">&lt;p&gt;It's because of its "psycho-pop" art style. They used pink blood for their art style type, and also censorship probably. Also, they coined the term "psycho-pop".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, fun fact, the blood at one point was planned to be red (it was in &lt;a href="http://danganronpa.wikia.com/wiki/DISTRUST" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISTRUST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the beta version) but when Monokuma's art design was chosen, everything was changed, even the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

Vegeta on the other hand, never had that chance. As a note, Vegeta did reach Super Saiyajin 4 after gaining power from one of Bulma's machines, then he fused with Goku to beat the One-Star Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20416">&lt;p&gt;As an additional note to the accepted answer, Gotenks was able to reach SSJ3 only because the fusion dramatically increased his power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gohan never reached it because he had the Old Kai awake his sleeping powers (Mystical Gohan form) which made his power comparable to a SSJ3.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41404">&lt;p&gt;Super Saiyajin 3 transformation takes in a lot of energy. And to perfect that form, Goku needed to work on his stamina, which he did when he was at King Kai's planet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to fighting Kid Buu, he had not perfected the form. Infact, that form was even hidden from Vegeta, because Vegeta had no clue that there was a possibility of moving beyond the Super Saiyajin 2 level. In case you remember, when fighting Kid Buu, Goku tried recharging himself in the Super Saiyajin 3 form, when Vegeta was the bait, but he failed to restore his strength, unlike what he expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, while fighting Beerus, his energy was not even close to that of the God of Destruction. I think , the SSJ 3 form is a form that requires extremely high energy surge. As for Gotenks, SSJ3 was possible, because of the combined strength of Goten and Trunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Vegeta, well, even though he is the Prince of all Saiyans, he lacks the potential to power up to that level. And he lacks training, unlike Goku, we can never stop himself from continuing to train and fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half saiyans have the potential to reach SSJ3, however, Toriyama hasn't focussed much on the SSJ3 transformation part. And there ain't no discrete logic to support the transformation as such.

Why would you give up/sacrifice/destroy truth?

It does not necessarily reflect the original author's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmarked Spoilers Below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of Ed's sacrifice at the end of the series is that he finally understood the truth about alchemy, and, more specifically, the Law of Equivalent Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the intro, Alphonse says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the series, Ed and Al believe wholeheartedly that almost everything can be solved with alchemy. That's why they attempted human transmutation to begin with - they see everything as an alchemical equation. They felt that there must be some way to bring back their mother using alchemy, and that there must be some way to restore their original bodies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the series progresses, the brothers begin to discover holes in this seemingly ironclad (fullmetal?) law of alchemy. They discover that Izumi Curtis had also attempted human transmutation, trying and failing to revive her infant child. Following this, when Edward spends some time in Resembool after visiting the ruins of Xerxes, Hohenheim suggests that the creature they transmuted back at the beginning of the series was not even their mother. Upon examining the remains, he and Pinako confirm that this is indeed the case. Knowing this, Edward comes to the conclusion that &lt;strong&gt;bringing someone back from the dead is impossible,&lt;/strong&gt; which he tells Izumi in Episode 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mTqR9m.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mTqR9m.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revalation is significant. If there are some things that are impossible with alchemy, like bringing someone back from death, it implies that there may be some things that do not have a set alchemical value. This throws a wrench into the law of Equivalent Exchange, since &lt;strong&gt;if not everything can be quantified by alchemy, Equivalent Exchange cannot be the only truth of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this other truth is, though, eludes everyone up until the climax of the series, when Edward performs his final transmutation. He realizes how he can get his brother back &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; keep his body. As he does this, Hohenheim seems to figure it out, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/csJyT.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/csJyT.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Edward faces Truth, and offers him his own personal gate of truth in exchange for Alphonse's body. They exchange the following dialogue (English sub of Japanese dub):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Truth: You would lower yourself to become just a normal person, unable to use alchemy?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: "Lower myself," nothing. I've been just a person from the start. An insignificant human who couldn't save a little girl who had been made into a Chimera.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Truth: You're sure you'll be okay without it?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward (thinking of his friends and family): Even without alchemy, I still have them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Truth: That is the right answer, alchemist. You have beaten me. Take it with you. All of it! The back door is over there, Edward Elric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward has realized something critical, something that circumvents even Equivalent Exchange. What gives him value is not his ability to do alchemy, but his loved ones. In Ed's eyes, &lt;strong&gt;he does not exchange anything of value, yet gains "everything" (his brother, his friends, and his family).&lt;/strong&gt; He has not been lowered or decreased at all by losing his gate ("I've just been a person from the start"), but has instead increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphonse expands on this principle when he meets with the Hughes family in the epilogue: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alphonse: We were afforded a lot of happiness, a lot of happiness, in a lot of places by a lot of people...including Mr. Hughes. And so, now, we feel it's out turn to return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Gracia: Is that equivalent exchange, like the alchemists say?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Alphonse: No, by taking ten, and giving ten, it all ends up the same. So we take ten, put something of ourselves on top of it, and return 11. It's not much, but it's a new principle we've hit upon. Now we have to go and prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This "new principle" as Alphonse puts it, is that hidden truth beyond Equivalent Exchange. It's what Edward did to get Al's body back - he took what was there (his own body), added some of himself (his gate) and was able to come out with more than what he came in with (his body and his brother).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry reinforces this idea again right at the end of the last episode: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: Equivalent exchange! I'll give you half of my life, if you give me half of yours!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Winry: Why do alchemists have to be like this? The principle of equivalent exchange is all nonsense, isn't it? &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Winry: It really is nonsense. Never mind half, I'll give you all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward (after some banter): You really are amazing! You turn equivalent exchange on its ear so easily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry, by giving Ed "her whole life" (or at least 85 percent of it) is once again not decreasing or losing anything, but instead gaining something, just as Ed is gaining something by giving her his whole life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed drives this point home with his final line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: There's no point to lessons that don't bring with them pain. People can't gain anything without sacrificing something, after all. But once you've successfully endured that pain, you gain a heart that is stout enough not to be overcome by anything. Yeah, a heart made fullmetal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go through a painful lesson, you pay the price in pain, and in turn, gain a lesson learned, but you also gain something extra - a heart made fullmetal, able to withstand anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question, he beats Truth by realizing that there are things alchemy cannot quantify, things with infinite value, and by choosing them over alchemy, he has effectively gained everything and lost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

(See link for bigger version of image below.) On the back of the photograph, there is something written in what is probably Russian.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/c7DFPm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/c7DFPm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;back side of Nazarov&amp;#39;s family photograph&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is written on the back of the photograph? I have at best an extremely poor knowledge of the Cyrillic alphabet and the Russian language, so I have not managed to read everything written there. My guesses so far are, going line by line:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ivanov&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Natasha&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yuri&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;[I can't figure out what the middle two letters are.]&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Balkutsk 1951 [This is the line that Kirika reports to Mireille, so it must be correct.]&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41126">&lt;p&gt;Your guesses are correct. Some of the Cyrillic letters here are written in a strange way: nobody writes &#1096; ("sh") on the second line in this way. The letter &#1080; on the third line  has an underline that doesn't really belong. Abstracting away such gratuitous elements, I think the fourth line is "&#1052;&#1080;&#1096;&#1072;" (Misha, a masculine name) in which the two middle letters are distorted with extraneous pen strokes. The full text for completeness: &lt;/p&gt;

(Actually, in Russian the family name would be written in plural form, i.e., "&#1048;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;"). &#1041;&#1072;&#1083;&#1082;&#1091;&#1090;&#1089;&#1082; being the town where the photo is taken in 1951. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're new to the series and want to know where to start, go with the manga first, then watch the anime, because the anime is based on the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know the differences, I have spotted a few changes in season 1 that differ from the manga. The examples below are from chapter 120:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In the anime, Alibaba became a Dark Metal Vessel user or Dark Djinn Equip near the end of season 1, which isn't part of the manga.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Another change is that Hakuryuu got his arm &lt;strong&gt;cut off&lt;/strong&gt; in a sword fight trying to protect Alibaba, instead of falling off after the Zagan arc in the manga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="4484" Title="When did Kakashi and Obito awaken their Mangekyou Sharingan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In chapter 604 of the manga, it is shown that Kakashi kills Rin. This fulfills the requirement to activate the Mangekyou Sharingan. So that should have been the moment when Kakashi was able to use the Mangekyou Sharingan. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, the Yellow Flash was still alive when this happens, so this means that Naruto was not yet born. This clearly points to the fact that from the very beginning of the Naruto series, Kakashi had his Mangekyou Sharingan activated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Kakashi first fought Itachi (when Itachi and Kisame appear at Konoha) and faced the Tsukuyomi he was devastated in a moment, even though he had his Mangekyou Sharingan active (though not used). But the next time they face (during the rescue mission of Gara), he was able to withstand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now my first question is, was Kakashi unaware of his Mangekyou Sharingan until he faced Itachi, or was he not proficient in using it. Also why in the Naruto series (I mean the series before the start of Shippuden) didn't Kakashi use his Mangekyou Sharingan?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now for my second question, in the same chapter, a few pages back, just when Kakashi strikes the blow at Rin, Obito's vision starts to fade as he can sense Rin dying. Does this mean Obito's Mangekyou Sharingan was awakened at the same time? We know that Kakashi and Obito shares the same &quot;other dimension&quot; because of the same Sharingan that the both use (not the same eye, but the eye of the same Uchiha). So does the same apply for their activation of Mangekyou Sharingan?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4486">&lt;p&gt;Kakashi and Obito awoke their Mangekyou at the same time: when Kakashi killed Rin.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ab8y.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ab8ym.jpg" alt="Obito and Kakashi&amp;#39;s Mangekyou awakened."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;Obito (left) and Kakashi (right) awakening their Mangekyou. From chapter 605, pages 4 and 5.&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as for why Kakashi never used it before his fight with Deidara, I think there's no definitive answer. However, I can think of two different educated guesses: one is in-universe, while the other is out-of-universe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-universe explanation: As you said, Kakashi was either unaware of or unable to control his Mangekyou Sharingan. I tend to think the former is the case, since he passed out as soon as he awoke his Mangekyou, and probably had no memory of awakening it (&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake#Mangeky.C5.8D_Sharingan" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Kakashi's page on Naruto wiki&lt;/a&gt; seems to agree with this explanation). If this is the case, after his fight with Itachi he most likely tested to see if he had the Mangekyou, finding out he did, and thus trained in order to perfect its use.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out-of-universe explanation: Kishimoto hadn't thought the whole story through. Since Tobi had not made an appearance in the first Naruto series, Kishi had not yet thought about who he would be. If this is the case, then Kakashi's back story had not yet been planned, as well as Obito's. This would make it plausible that Kakashi was not initially planned to have a Mangekyou, since his is transplanted. After the Kakashi Gaiden, however, the important characters are all introduced, which means he had most likely planned for Obito to be Tobi, and about the link between his and Kakashi's Sharingan.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="54004">&lt;p&gt;I think Kakashi didn't use Mangekyou Sharingan before because it took to much chakra. And since he is not an Uchiha, it drained all of his chakra at once. And the next thing about him fainting right after activating the mangekyou for the first time, its the same reason. Exhaustion. No need to explain in universe and out universe blah blah blah. During the gara incident, he used it but had to be bed ridden. Same reason drainage of both physical and mental strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The announcement does not specify whether the new series is a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been done before for example with Magi. Post season 2, several episodes relating to Sinbad's history were released so that the Season 3 had enough source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a original mini arc written by the author himself. According to the &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1495671" rel="noreferrer"&gt;discussion on MAL.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is basically a movie, but instead of releasing on theaters, it&#8217;s been released on TV in 4 episodes....&lt;br&gt;
  Anyhow, I&#8217;m cool with that as long as it is written by the mangaka (which it is). Hopefully we will get an announcement later this year (or maybe next) about a possible sequel in 2017.... I doubt there won&#8217;t be one given the great success of this franchise.&lt;br&gt;
  Also, this was never announced as a second season to begin with, so I&#8217;m not sure why some of you&#8217;re surprised by this... It was announced as Nanatsu no Taizai (2016), not Nanatsu no Taizai Second Season (2016) from the very beginning. If this was indeed a second season, they would have added that to the title the day it was announced, simple as that.&lt;br&gt;
  Anyway, looking forward this original mini arc story written by Nakaba Suzuki himself. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="2470" Title="Are Sword Art Online and Accel World related?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been hearing loads of theories about Sword Art Online and Accel World being related due to the fact that they refer to NerveGear and such in Accel World. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have also been hearing that the plot of Accel World was made by Kirito.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there some sort of confirmation of this? Or trustworthy speculation?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2471">&lt;p&gt;They are in the same universe.  Sword Art Online's Nerve Gear was elaborated in Accel World as a precursor to the implants seen in Accel World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything further than that is likely speculation, until either light novel reveals more details.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4692">&lt;p&gt;The author, Kawahara Reki, didn't clearly say whether they are in the same timeline or not. During the Sakuracon Festival Interviews, he answered like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you were creating the &lt;a href="http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Project_Alicization"&gt;Alicization&lt;/a&gt; arc in &lt;em&gt;Sword Art Online&lt;/em&gt;, was the technology used in the Alicization arc carried over as a foundation to &lt;em&gt;Accel World&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is true that the technology used in Alicization could be, or is the foundation of the technology being used in &lt;em&gt;Accel World&lt;/em&gt;, but at this point, like I said, it might be similar technologies having a similar technological chain, but it hasn't been made clear that it is in fact the same world. The two worlds could just have a similar technological advance. Also, as I noted before, if I were to clearly state the two worlds are the same, the number of things that need to be resolved in order for such a thing to be clearly possible is, the numbers are tens of thousands of times greater than I can even hope to do right now! Seeing a movie like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where it took a bunch of properties into one cohesive title, I have to say that the creative staff on that movie is quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original link is &lt;a href="http://www.sutoraikuanime.com/2013/04/interview-with-kawahara-reki.html"&gt;"Interview with Kawahara Reki" on Sutoraiku Anime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8352">&lt;p&gt;Sword Art Online and Accel World exist within the same universe but at different times. Similar to Batman Beyond being in the future of Justice League and Batman the Animated Series. The technology in SAO is the first gen version of the tech in Accel World.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9885">&lt;p&gt;SAO and AW are related because they have the same author and also in the one chapter of SAO and AW (versus) they meet and duel. (fact)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also think that the timeline also looks like this: SAO may be the first generation (nerve gear) until technology improves until the period of AW (neuro linker) is created. 
(opinion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of past and future met and they have a duel because of that machine Kirito used and Silver Crow using that accceleration program. (opinion)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="11302">&lt;p&gt;Another point to add to this that I have yet to see is that when Haruyuki was looking up the older generation tech, they show a picture. At first glance, I saw the similarities, and it was when he actually said "Nerve Gear" (in &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PpQRY.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Episode 22&lt;/a&gt;) that I freaked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that it's definite that it's connected, but really, it's totally possible. At the end of the first season of SAO, he was given the seed that would enable other people to create their own worlds and games that others could come into. If the worlds aren't connected, then I'd be very disappointed, but at least it would make great fan fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Is there any website providing script from mangas in textual format, so that I could just paste it in Google Translator? There are so many Chinese mangas that I cannot read, and it's to hard for me to rewrite the signs into Google Translator by finger.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26381">&lt;p&gt;There is not a page that I know of that stores the text version of manga, actually I'm not sure such a page would be legal considering the huge legal struggle over lyric sites in the past. However, what you are asking is not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a technology called optical character recognition (OCR) which is software scanners use to generate text versions of the scanned document. There are several programs that implement this technology for use in translation software. Some are available as apps available on your phone and can be found in the app store for your device. While there are many implementations available, one such implementation called &lt;a href="http://capture2text.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Capture2Text&lt;/a&gt; uses OCR specifically for the use of translating manga, visual novels, and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These programs will copy the characters to your clipboard which you can then put into your favorite translator. There are also some programs available out there that will search multiple translators at once or even allow you to create your own dictionary of words to look up words/phrases in.&lt;/p&gt;

That doesnt seem to have any sense. Why he didnt keep the quirk to heal new injuries in new battles? That would seem to be a very useful quirk, even if fighting All Might again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47494">&lt;p&gt;When All for One first appears in the manga in chapter 59, he talks about, how he wished to have gotten the regeneration quirk sooner (it probably took a long time to get that quirk, since it is so rare), because his wounds had already healed at the time, when he finally got his hands on it. So for those injuries, which had been caused by All Might, the quirk was useless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't say anywhere in the manga, that he doesn't still have it. So, it is very likely, that he still has it and uses it for new injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;Yomi Yomi no Mi&lt;/em&gt; enables the soul of the user to return to his body &lt;strong&gt;after his death&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does the &lt;em&gt;Ope Ope no Mi&lt;/em&gt; respawn after the Perennial Youth Operation (the user's death) or after the death of the operated person? Does the &lt;em&gt;Yomi Yomi no Mi&lt;/em&gt; respawn after the &quot;First&quot; death or after the soul leaves this world forever?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least for the &lt;em&gt;Ope Ope no Mi&lt;/em&gt; there is no body left to contain the fruit's powers and after Doflamingo wanted to become immortal by Rosinante eating the fruit and performing the operation, the powers can not be stored in the operated person's body.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Could one create an army of immortals using one of this DFs?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41365">&lt;p&gt;No, these fruits cannot create an immortal army, they are not designed with that in mind. Even after giving someone eternal youth, that is all he will get, he will just remain "young" forever. Anyone will still be able to kill the user in a fight, he may die to an accident etc. The same applies Yomi Yomi no Mi, you get another life but you are not immortal. Also, even if someone has the Yomi Yomi no mi, and his head gets cut there is no body to return, because he will die again immeditally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ope Ope no Mi respawns after the users death (the one who eat the fruit) because the person who gained eternal life has no "connection" with the fruit itself.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41550">&lt;p&gt;Actually, you got it wrong. The Ope Ope no Mi only gives eternal youth, and the Yomi Yomi no Mi gives 1 extra shot at life and it's not as overpowered as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to perform the eternal surgery on someone like Makino, she would just live forever and wouldn't become stronger or invincible. She would just get the ability to never die from old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the same with the Yomi Yomi fruit, which only gives you an extra life. For instance, if you drown because you ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, a devil fruit, when your soul comes back you will just drown again and then be dead for good. It doesn't give you any extra power.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="40273" Title="Is there any physical difference between Gohan in base form and Gohan in mystic form?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The only physical difference I've ever seen between Gohan in base form, and Gohan in mystic form, it's a radiance he displays for a second in the Battle of Gods movie when turning into mystic form. Aside of this minimum difference, is there any other change in his appearence when he is in base form compared to when he is in mystic form?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cM5y2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cM5y2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40290">&lt;h2&gt;EXCLUDING/PRE DRAGON BALL SUPER (ANIME)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not much of difference or drastic change regarding his physical appearance between his base form and the power Old Kai&#333;shin unlocks for Gohan if we exclude the Dragon Ball Super anime. Even if there is a slight change in his physical appearance it is unfortunately not noted down by anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what Goku says in the manga after Gohan powers up with his new found powers (Tank&#333;bon Volume 41, chapter 496):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Son Goku:&lt;/strong&gt; &#8220;It re-really is incredible&#8230; It&#8217;s super-duper&#8230;! Absolutely unbelievable&#8230; Your appearance has hardly changed&#8230; And you ain&#8217;t even a Super Saiyan&#8230; Yet you&#8217;ve been taken to su-such an extreme&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elder Kai&#333;shin:&lt;/strong&gt; &#8220;Hmph, transforming isn&#8217;t good. That Super whatever-it&#8217;s-called is the wrong way of doing things&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;INCLUDING DRAGON BALL SUPER (ANIME)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In episode 88, Toei seems to distinguish Gohan's base form and the power Old Kai&#333;shin unlocked by adding a "hair bang" while he was using the the power Old Kai&#333;shin unlocked. Although this may not be a 100% accurate way to distinguish his physical appearance, but we will have to wait till episode 90 comes out and see if Gohan will have that "hair bang" only when he's using the power Old Kai&#333;shin unlocked or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that in episode 88 it is somewhat implied by Piccolo that Gohan has not been using the power Old Kai&#333;shin unlocked (at least only in the Dragon Ball Super anime) ever since after his fight with Super Buu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; By radiance I am assuming you mean the white aura surrounding him. That is actually pretty common (at least for most of the Saiyans, humans and Namekians) when someone powers up in his/her base.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="50948" Title="Why did Luffy not command the Straw Hat Grand Fleet against the Big Mom Pirates?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;Whole Cake Island&quot; arc, Luffy and his crew were having a fierce battle with the Big Mom Pirates. However, they didn't ask or intend to get help from the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The alliance would surely have helped make their mission to retrieve the Poneglyph a lot easier and the Grand Fleet swore to protect Luffy, so they would have been great assets, especially in the final battle.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why didn't they ask or intend to get help from the Straw Hat Grand Fleet?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50953">&lt;p&gt;The Whole Cake Island mission was never supposed to be a war against the Big Mom pirates, though it turned out to have significant fighting. The main aim was to retrieve Sanji as quickly as possible and then head to Wano. Robin only asks Luffy to copy the Road Poneglyph if they find one / get the chance to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall the end of the Zou arc, both Law and Zoro mention how dangerous and risky a move it is to be confronting Big Mom while they were already set to clash with Kaido. However, Luffy is adamant about getting Sanji back, and hence they split up. Not to mention the Grand Fleet, not even the entire Straw Hat crew headed to WCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you've mentioned, the Grand Fleet could have been of use in a number of situations, whether during WCI or the coming arc in Wano. However, Luffy doesn't really approve of the fleet at all, as summarized in the wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Luffy rejected their offer, as he wanted to sail freely on the seas without having to command anyone. In response to this, the crews made the decision to still serve Luffy, but only when he needed them to, and consumed sake cups to form the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He'll probably only rely on them when they're around, and the situation forces it somehow. That's just how his character has been developed. Further, Oda has teased that the final ending of One Piece will be a war so great it would make Marineford look like filler. Many people expect it to be the arc where the Straw Hat Grand Fleet will be on full display.&lt;/p&gt;

It should be obvious from the title that the author is very particular and non-traditional with their word usage. As strange as it sounds, the title of the series fits excellently. The English sub translation has flowed very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However something in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crunchyroll.com/worldend-what-do-you-do-at-the-end-of-the-world-are-you-busy-will-you-save-us/episode-8-slight-light-slight-hope-733689&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;episode 8&lt;/a&gt; struck me as odd at time mark 14:00 (if watch, start 30 seconds earlier for context).  Willem, the main character is speaking with Chtholly, who is in love with him. He is defending himself from light jealousy. When she counters an argument of his with an alternative case, he says with wit and resignation:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defenestrated in two seconds flat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did not know what &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;amp;q=defenestrated&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;defenstrated&lt;/a&gt;&quot; meant (basically, in this context, he acknowledges she has completely dismissed his argument and admits defeat.) It is not often I need to look up a word while watching anime, and on top of that figure out how that word fits the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I wonder now is if the translator used &quot;defenestrated&quot; as simply a literal translation of a Japanese word, without any real thought.  My suspicion is the opposite, that this is a contextual translation which would probably seem just as odd (and as oddly appropriate) in Japanese as it does in English. What kind of translation was it, and does it carry the Japanese intent well?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;Update&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;HotelCalifornia (HC) further researched this question, and it turns out my original interpretation of &quot;Defenestrated in two seconds flat.&quot; was incorrect. I had assumed the meaning to be [My argument was dismissed in two seconds flat.] As HC learned in the Japanese SE, a much better meaning uses a different subject and adds an object (both absent in the literal Japanese as well). So a translation that better fits conversation flow is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;I would have thrown Nygglatho out the window in two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Nygglatho is the attractive female adult leader of the &quot;warehouse&quot;, and Chtholly had just asked what Willem would have done if she had crept onto the couch where he was sleeping, instead of the teenage female who had actually done so.) So the primary meaning for &lt;strong&gt;defenestrated&lt;/strong&gt; was the proper one, not the figurative meaning of &lt;strong&gt;dismiss&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40953">&lt;p&gt;To "defenestrate" is the act of throwing somebody out the window. Maybe what he was saying was that an idea or an argument by him was shot down very quickly by the girl. I have not watched it yet, but from what you said, it may be that he is saying that anything he said was not cared for and simply "thrown out the window" very quickly. It is rather a literal translation but I think it might actually have been on purpose to show that his argument was ignored completely.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40998">&lt;p&gt;After listening to the exchange a number of times, it sounds to me as if he is saying&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ni by&#333; inai ni mado kara suteteru na.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ni by&#333;&lt;/em&gt;: two seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;mado kara suteteru&lt;/em&gt;: throwing out from/through a window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the rest of the sentence is mostly structure, and immaterial to this answer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My translation of the line would be something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[My argument] didn't last for two seconds before being thrown out [a window].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the translation (though the word choice may have been odd) was a literal translation, while also carrying some of the Japanese intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/q/48637/10327"&gt;I asked about it&lt;/a&gt; on the Japanese SE, and have determined two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I misinterpreted the subject of the phrase- rather than his argument being dismissed, he is referring to what he would do "if it was Nygglatho" (namely, throwing her out the window). This applies to Crunchyroll's English translation as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase &#12300;&#31379;&#12363;&#12425;&#25237;&#12370;&#25448;&#12390;&#12427;&#12301; (to abandon by throwing [something] out through a window) is a slangy phrase usually used to tell someone what they can do with an inferior product (akin to the English phrase "shove it up your ass." So, the Japanese phrase is figurative in a different way than the direct English translation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An updated translation could be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Nygglatho? I'd] throw her out the window in two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

And this was done without Nagato's knowledge. Then the Second Shinobi War started, after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After implanting the eyes, Madara waited for years to find a person who could be used as a tool. This "tool" was supposed to guide Nagato to properly use the Rinnegan at the right time, bringing Madara back alive, at his prime state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in order to find a suitable "tool", Madara connected himself with the Gedo Statue and siphoned it's life essence. He would die the moment he disconnected, as he was far past his natural death.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Rido can transfer his soul into/possess other people's bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, if he bites someone while in that other body, will they turn into a vampire? Or would it be like if any other non-pure blood bit them?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46225">&lt;p&gt;No, they wouldn't because what Rido does is possession where he is controlling another's body, as such he can only do what the other body can do. This is shown with Shizuka Hio when she was possessing the body of her relative Maria Kurenai and was able to use Maria's abilities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She could also possess the bodies of other vampires like Rido Kuran, resulting in obtaining their powers, such as using Maria's body to see through the eyes of birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while Rido was in Senri's body, Rima was able to attack Senri, indicating that the forced obedience the lesser vampires have to Purebloods does not apply, rather the hesitation to attack Senri at first was because it was still Senri's body that they'd be hurting. If Rido's status as a Pureblood was transferred to Senri and thus allowing him to create Level D's, then this obedience would have been transferred as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can use the &lt;a href="http://reborn.wikia.com/wiki/Hyper_Dying_Will_Mode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hyper Dying Will Mode&lt;/a&gt; which is a calmer version of the Dying Will Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, the whole 1st season is dedicated to building up relationships so that the family bond is solid and powerful so that they can really go crazy in season 2. However, after it starts getting crazy, it never stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I need to point out the similarities, but in particular the design of the skirt, the straps on the front of the dress, the wand, the bow on the neck, the crown, the hair style, and the flowers on the outfit are all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it seems that Sue's dialogue of the episode references Meruru, so there's no doubt that this is who Sue was cosplaying as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wood Clone Technique, unlike other clone techniques, &lt;strong&gt;do not disappear when hit&lt;/strong&gt; and it is able to take damage to a certain degree. 'This, according to Madara Uchiha, makes it &lt;em&gt;the perfect clone technique that only he with his d&#333;jutsu was able to see through&lt;/em&gt;.' This happened in &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 577&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was most likely the reason why he preferred using wood clones. The two other possibilities you mentioned above are not possible and here are the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first possibility is wrong since both &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Shadow Clones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Wood_Clone_Technique" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wood Clones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;can perform jutsu&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="46138" Title="No. 17 official status" Body="&lt;p&gt;Be aware that this question contain spoilers from episode 127, 128 and 130.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So in episode 127 it was shown that 17 self sacrificed in order to save Goku and Vegeta. This resulted in referee saying that they could &lt;strong&gt;assume&lt;/strong&gt; that he self destructed which resulted in Jiren getting no penalty. Is this correctly translated from japanese? Hence meaning that the referee indicates that 17 wasn't officially eliminated. In the godpad he was also never removed by the Zenos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 128 when Vegeta dropped out we were only shown a part of the godpad, the top row. 17 is on the bottom row, meaning there is no official status about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 130 he makes a return. Were the previous episodes made like that in japanese as well (text wise) in order to indicate that 17 is still in the tournament? Or was he officially eliminated making his current status exactly what? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find this extremely confusing as in the past there had been some translation errors meaning that a sentence can hold a different meaning from the original intended one. As far as I can tell he was never officially removed, meaning referee and Zenos were aware of this and didn't remove him. Or are they surprised and were they perhaps unaware, meaning that there was an error of judgement on their side?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46141">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, The Omni Kings marking off fighters on the Godpad is only a formality and doesn't really have to do with a fighter being completely eliminated. The reason I make this argument is because of &lt;b&gt;Episode 110&lt;/b&gt;. After the &lt;i&gt;Spirit Bomb &lt;/i&gt; clash between &lt;i&gt;Goku and Jiren&lt;/i&gt;, Goku was presumed to be dead and there was a scene where the Omni Kings were right about to push the button, the world of void began to shake because of Goku. If Goku was a few seconds late, the Omni Kings would've pushed the button and would have to redo the same if Goku hadn't actually died because it was an &lt;b&gt;error on their parts and not the contestant's part.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also know by this that a contestant doesn't necessarily have to &lt;i&gt;only be knocked out to get eliminated. &lt;/i&gt;If he or she is either disqualified for violating a rule or dies or is in any position where the fighter cannot continue to fight in the tournament of power, the fighter is considered to be eliminated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to answer your main question. &lt;b&gt;Yes! Android 17 was presumed to be dead just like Goku was which as a result, meant elimination.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the other questions, The Omni Kings and even The Grand Priest were under the impression that &lt;b&gt;Android 17&lt;/b&gt; did die during the self-destruction. We know this based on what he said right after, where Jiren wasn't going to be disqualified because Android 17 chose to kill himself. Even in Episode 110, the Grand Priest &lt;b&gt;initially assumed that Goku died after the Spirit Bomb Struggle&lt;/b&gt; as he clearly stated that Jiren wouldn't be disqualified as &lt;b&gt;Goku died as a result of his own attack&lt;/b&gt;. With regard to them not showing the official elimination of Android 17(ie Marking him out on the God Pad), is something only the staff and writers would know. Perhaps there &lt;b&gt;wasn't sufficient time&lt;/b&gt; in the episode to include this bit of animation or maybe because Android 17's &lt;b&gt;death was confirmed by multiple characters&lt;/b&gt;(Based on Goku's, Vegeta's, Universe 7 fighters, Jiren's, Grand Priest's etc comments) and there wasn't really a reason to indicate the same or perhaps they left this out &lt;b&gt;because of what which happens in episode 130.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on my Initial Argument, I personally believe it honestly d wouldn't make a difference if they were to have marked Android 17 out. It would've just been considered an error in judgment which they would have redone. It would only matter if pressing the button on the Godpad causes the character to get erased or creates some form of restriction that prevents them from fighting in the tournament of power. As of now, it is solely there for the entertainment purposes and as a list for the Omni Kings to keep track of the fighters remaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="46772" Title="Did Endeavor ever fight All for One?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm watching the anime series and I have no idea what happened in the manga. In another topic here I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/46722/why-if-endeavor-solved-more-crimes-than-all-might-he-isnt-considered-the-number&quot;&gt;Why if Endeavor solved more crimes than All Might He isnt considered the number one hero&lt;/a&gt; . I know All Might defeated All for One (I can't recall if he told that in the anime or if I readed it online). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Endeavor ever fought All for One, and if he did, did he do well? That's my question. If that happened that could explain why one it's considered the number one hero perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46978">&lt;p&gt;There is no reference in the manga, except maybe for a tiny bit, see edit at the end of post. Manga spoilers ahead. But just as Arcane indicated, All For One is no Gentle Criminal but a serious opponent who goes for the kill if he sees it fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is explained in the Manga that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All for One has been like the boss of the mafia in the past, distributing Quirks among his underlings and himself as he liked. Not to mention that he set up the kid of the previous power holder of All Might's quirk to want to kill All Might. We basically know that All for One is evil incarnate regarding the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He may has no "death touch" like Overhaul, but given the damage he inflicted to All Might and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the previous power owners of All Mights quirk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if he ever would have fought Endeavor, it surely would have been mentioned, as surviving a fight with All for One is a feat in itself and requires a lot of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; since All for One is merely imprisoned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is a possibility that he will fight Endeavor in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A prison break would be a typical trope for a series with super villains. (Also that way that the hero killer glanced at All for One gives me hope.) At that point Endeavor would possibly still be #1 hero and see it as his upmost important duty, as the new symbol of piece, to contain him again. I would gamble on Endeavor to die trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; As I was hinted by a comment, there is this one occasion starting around chapter 85&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where All for One, who was still on the run at the time, got apprehended by the heroes. This happens in chapter 93: All for One gets attacked by some of the heroes after he fought a while with All Might and tried to break him psychologically. Other heroes evacuate civilians on the stage that prevented All Might from going all out. In particular, Endeavor unleashes some flames on All for One, which he dispels with ease. Endeavor also encourages All Might verbally. He was, together with the other heroes, just giving All Might a minute to catch his breath and rescue the civilians, All for One didn't even bother attacking Endeavor. I would hardly call this a fight rather than interfering in All Might's fight with All for One.&lt;/p&gt;

While the character would distort time and create alternate scenarios to simply absorb energy for experimental purposes(Note: He doesn't get stronger by absorbing the energy).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasingly, Japanese authorities have been cracking down on drugs and celebrities. Instead of letting these famous individuals off, like police seem to do in the U.S., the Japanese police and the country's media appear to make examples of them, stringing them out to dry.&lt;/strong&gt; This might be a good thing! It also might be a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Justin Sevakis puts it in his post &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-10-30/.94812"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Asia, &lt;strong&gt;it is expected that "talent" (singers/actors/show hosts/etc.) should be role models for society at large. When one gets in major criminal trouble (usually for drugs), what happens next is part of a very well-worn ritual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Step 1: It's almost unheard of for the talent in question to fight the charge. Things will proceed as if they are completely guilty. If they're famous enough, there may be a press conference, in which they will apologize for letting down all of their fans, and cry a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Step 2: The talent's management agency, record label(s), and any and all companies contracting that person to do work or appearances will immediately drop them from their rosters. Stores will remove their music, merchandise, and other media bearing their name from their shelves. Their listings will be removed from websites. I've never heard of whole anime series being pulled due to a voice actor getting in trouble, but it's fairly rare that a voice actor in prominent roles gets in trouble like this.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Step 3: Time passes, usually at least a year. The discs and merchandise that were pulled earlier quietly get put back on store shelves (and, presumably, streaming services). The talent works through the legal system, and once their debt to society is paid (any jail time, house arrest, or probation ends), the artist is free to try and restart their career, or go work at a convenience store. The artist is not re-instated at their old agencies, but is free to try again somewhere else and make a new start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few more such cases that have taken place in Japan such as the case with actor Shunta Nakamura, Manabu Oshio and others but the ones related to anime industry are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Noriko Sakai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noriko_Sakai"&gt;Noriko Sakai&lt;/a&gt;, 44, was found guilty of possessing and using amphetamines in August 2009 and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for three years. &lt;strong&gt;But unlike stars in much of the rest of the world, Sakai's conviction was marked as effectively the end of a career that made her popular across much of Asia.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Her record label, Victor Entertainment, had cancelled her contract and withdrawn all her albums from sale, while Toyota Motor had scrapped a lucrative advertising deal. &lt;strong&gt;However, in 2012 she returned to the entertainment business, and began performing in a stage play. She's since released new albums, and both it and a few of her older releases are back up on iTunes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aska_(singer)"&gt;Ryo Aska&lt;/a&gt; of Chage and Aska was arrested for drug posession in early 2014, which caused Walt Disney Japan to remove the music video for the song "On Your Mark." Walt Disney Japan also removed the video from Studio Ghibli collection of short films that was previously released on DVD. &lt;strong&gt;In a way, Disney erased the short film from Studio Ghibli's back catalogue. It's as if it never existed.&lt;/strong&gt; All Chage and Aska websites and social media accounts have either been frozen since then, or taken down, and are not active as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Why isn't Orochimaru releasing the Edo Tensei seal of Hashirama?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't that be helpful, as Madara would no longer be able to use his Senjutsu chakra?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6442">&lt;p&gt;Madara has obtained the cells of Hashirama and has them infused into his body, irrespective of what happens to Edo tensei hashirama it will not affect anything with respect to Madara because he has been revived using the &lt;a href="http://de.narutopedia.eu/wiki/Ged%C5%8D%3a_Rinne_Tensei_no_Jutsu" rel="nofollow"&gt;rinne tensei&lt;/a&gt; technique of six paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short madara has both powers of Senju and Uciha and on top of that he is completely by himself (unlike being under Kabuto's control briefly when he was revived). &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6447">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where is Orochimaru?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is currently with the Kages helping them heal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why isn't he releasing the seal on Hashirama?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Orochimaru first used Edo Tensei on Hashirama, Tobirama, Sarutobi, and Minato, Hashirama was already not bound to Orochimaru's control. The two contributing factors to this is that Hashirama is very strong and that Zetsu bodies were made of Hashirama cells. Thus releasing the restraint would not matter anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I am pretty sure Orochimaru already released the seal as the rest of the Edo Tensei Hokage's are able to fight against Obito freely. Since Orochimaru is supporting the Shinobi Alliance, there would be no reason for him to keep them restrained.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Usually with anime, there are the heroes (aka protagonists), and the villains (aka antagonists).  There might be some characters that switch sides, or the sides might not be ultimate good or evil, but you can almost always draw those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Aru Zombie Shoujo no Sainan, you think the group of college kids are the protagonists, but you are quickly shown they are not.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I heard the voices of the 2 girls, I thought &quot;Oh, OK, they're the protagonists&quot;, since, in my experience, Japanese voice actors tend to play roles on the same side (good/evil), with similar characteristics, and those were the voices of the good guys.  Though I was also quickly shown otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the end, I was thoroughly confused as to who was on which side, or if there were even sides at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47692">&lt;p&gt;While most anime follow the good vs bad script Aru Zonbi Sh&#333;jo no Sainan is not one of them. We have two sides: the zombies, and the zombie adversaries.  Neither can be described as good as both commit immoral acts. For example, the zombies kill innocents (the caretaker in the first place), while the zombie adversaries constantly betray each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the story of Aru Zonbi Sh&#333;jo no Sainan can be understood as a clash of values. In Euphrosyne Studions worldview, loyalty plays a major role. This is demonstrated by her punishment of Masahiro Abe and her venturous rescue attempts to save Alma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The college kids on the other hand are betrayed by Sayaka. Who is betrayed by Takanashi. Who is betrayed by Mako. And I nearly forgot Abe tried to sell his group out too.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="23921" Title="Where is Ergastulum located?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gangstamanga.wikia.com/wiki/Ergastulum&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ergastulum&lt;/a&gt; has the architecture of a typical Italian city. Yet, the newspaper is printed in English and the cars drive on the right, although road signs and the like do have a European feel to them. The police cars are also reminiscent of LAPD cruisers, in that they are black and white. Finally, from looking at the currency depicted in the anime, it seems that the city prints its own money.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvGgR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvGgR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/coupVw2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do remember a scene where a newspaper article shows something happening in Paris, France. So I do think the story takes place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have looked over the &lt;em&gt;Gangsta&lt;/em&gt; Wiki and so far it does not seem to have any information on where exactly the city is located. Do we or will we know where Ergastulum is located? Is it its own country?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="24011">&lt;p&gt;The setting is generally set somewhere in France or Italy since both people from the Mafia and Perrier (a sparkling water drink from France) are common. Worick also says 'ciao' before killing a gangster, which is an informal Italian word that can be used as a goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have pointed out, there is the newspaper article that states an incident occurred in France. There is also the fact that people call Nicolas an 'oriental' which is what Asians are commonly called in Europe, so it is likely set somewhere in Europe. Also, remember that France and Italy share a land border, and so are very close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26150">&lt;p&gt;The wikia for Ergastulum says that it is a mix between Italy and America. Nicholas is also half Italian and Half Japanese. There is even an uncle sam poster in the gun shop on the first episode, as well as an alley way containing posters of American soldiers. And of course all the references to italian and ancient roman culture as well, with the fact that civilians are allowed to buy and own guns, like here in America.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I have watched all the Mobile Suit Gundam series and many other transforming robot genre series, but I want to know which is the first series that started the transforming/morphing mobile suit/robot genre in anime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here, transforming/morphing is changing from aircraft/armour to humanoid/creature form or any other forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4358">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume that you mean a giant robot that transforms into something else, usually a vehicle. If that's the case then you have two candidates depending on how further you want to specify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brave Raideen&lt;/strong&gt; was released in 1975 and it featured a giant robot that transformed into a bird shaped rocket ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getter Robo&lt;/strong&gt; was first released in 1974 and it featured three space ships that &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt; into a three different giant robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bfn5s.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An honorable mention goes to &lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Magma&lt;/strong&gt; which was first released in 1966. The titular character changed into a rocket ship, although there was no transforming mehcanism shown, so I (personally) wouldn't include him.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="43270" Title="Why did Saruhiko Fushimi cross over to the side of the Blues?" Body="&lt;p&gt;During season 1, Yata and Fushimi have mini confrontations. I learned later in the season that they only hate each other because Fushimi joined Homra's most hated clan, Septer 4. Why does he do this? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47227">&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if this can help you, but I can at least give you my opinion from what I read in &lt;em&gt;K -Lost Small World-&lt;/em&gt;. This may be a long explanation so if you go to the bottom, you can see my short-term answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Before Fushimi and Yata, joined HOMRA, it was their own small world; both were really close and happy. Until they joined HOMRA. Yata started to have his own world with other people, that it had lesser and lesser time with Fushimi. Lesser and lesser until Yata wasn't Fushimi's light anymore. One time, the blue king asked for a meeting with them; and one of the representatives was Fushimi which Munakata took notice of. Though Munakata did show that he wants Fushimi to work for him, Fushimi didn't agree just yet, though he did ask if it is possible to change clans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the manga that I read, it was only until chapter 11, but feel free to check if it's been updated. The chapters 12 to 17 are just story strips. It ended with Munakata telling the green king to pull back from attacking Fushimi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a few answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He betrayed HOMRA to get Yata's attention. (Cause of Yata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He went to SCEPTER 4 because Munakata gave him a choice. (Cause of Munakata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He went to SCEPTER 4 because he knows he can be of use to the society and doesn't want to end up like his father. (Cause of Nikki)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He went to SCEPTER 4 because he thinks that he belongs there, and is not fit to be called a Red Clansman. (Cause of Mikoto)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my opinion: 
He did it for him, SCEPTER 4's, HOMRA's, and for other people's own good. If he stayed in HOMRA, nothing will progress for him. Yes, he is a skilled fighter. But if his brain is put to waste I think he can feel himself becoming like Nikki. So that helps himself, SCEPTER 4, and other people. Now, what about HOMRA? What I like about him going to another group was that he could be a bridge that can lead HOMRA and SCEPTER 4 to an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Do Elizabeth Midford and Ciel Phantomhive stay together even after Ciel turns into a demon in Season 2 episode 12?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="22859">&lt;p&gt;At the end of that episode, it was shown that Ciel went to leave his mansion along with Sebastian. Sebastian then jumped off a cliff with Ciel on his arms. Considering this, it is very likely that Ciel didn't stay together with Elizabeth. He left her (dumped her, whatever you call that) to go with Sebastian, possibly to the underworld, considering the settings of the manga and anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciel left a card saying that he died to all his friends (Prince Soma, Undertaker, Greill Sutcliffe).

&lt;p&gt;He was then seen princess carried by Sebastian in a flowery field and the sound effect suggests that they jumped of the cliff.

You see the Dragon Balls getting stronger after Kami's ones, maybe because they knew how they function properly while Kami was still getting to know his limits. So, maybe Kami could revive people but left it to the Dragon Balls as they were harder to get, and were more of a trial for people; or, Kami just believed, "Shenron can bestow any wish as long as it does not exceed the power of his creator" because he did not know how to make Shenron more powerful. As much as I can remember and can find it was only Kami who said this, so most likely this was only a theory of his.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4443">&lt;p&gt;It is theorized that Shenron does have the same power as Kami but the difference is that Shenron exclusively grants wishes, so he is much more efficient in that regard when using Kami's power.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm a few chapters into &lt;em&gt;Hyperdimensional Neptunia Re;Birth 1&lt;/em&gt; and I understand the game is a large rework of the previous first Neptunia game. I'm not overly interested in the mechanical changes, but I'd like to know how the story has changed - as it's been mentioned a few times already about being overhauled.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPumP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPumP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does Re;Birth 1's story differ from the original?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="24238">&lt;p&gt;Without spoiling you anything, I can say that the main setting is the same in both games; Neptune loses her memory, and starts an adventure alongside Compa and IF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Re;Birth 1, the dialogue is the thing that has been radically changed. They made the storyline more steadier and more diverse and included special events which can't be found in the original game. There are also more comical scenes included, due to the success of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/16157/Choujigen_Game_Neptune_The_Animation"&gt;Choujigen Game Neptune The Animation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which had a rather lighthearted atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vert, Noire, and Blanc have now more impact through the whole story, unlike in the original game in which they only had involvement near the end of the game. New side characters also appear in this remake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the original game, Re;Birth 1 also has two different endings, namely the Normal Ending and the True Ending. Althought these are fairly different from the original, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/01/hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth1s-story-localization-changed/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an interview with the director Shingo Onodera and Idea Factory CEO Haru Akenaga, regarding the changes made in the remake.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31870">&lt;p&gt;There is quite some differences between the original PS3 game and the Re;Birth PS Vita game aside from mechanics. the basic premise of the plot is still the same but the progression though it and the finale are different&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original game, much like Re;Birth, the 4 nations were on floating continents however in the original game they moved. this played to a mechanic where you had to go through dungeons in order for time to progress before one of the other nations where nearby for you to cross over. in Re;Birth it appears they don't move as the world map doesn't show them changing places&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the original game every dungeon was on it's own floating island which circled a nation so more or less the 4 nation's main continents were more or less a giant city. this isn't the case in Re;Birth with some of the dungeons being on the same landmass as a nation's capital&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Main Plot&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alot of the elements of the main plot remain consistent between the 2 such as the quest to get the Keyfragments to release Histoire, IF being a fan of Vert and being used to poison Neptune. Avanir taking control of Lastation, Afoire's final plan to destroy Gameindasti by colliding the 4 nations and Green Heart proudly boasting about her breast size to Lady White Heart at the beginning prompting Lady White Heart to call her "Thunder Tits". however the events within the main plot have been changed up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Fragments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the original game all 4 Key Fragments were guarded by the Guard Vermin, one in each nation which only was accessible after the 2nd Arc of Lastation, Lowee and Leanbox. Planeptune's Keyfragment acquisition was still different as indicated in the screenshot as it was this dungeon that is shown in the Screenshot that the Keyfragment was obtained and it wasn't accessed by Neptune and Compa falling down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Missing Characters in the Main Plot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent from Re;Birth was Nisa and Gust who represented their titler companies, Nippon Ichi Software America (the American branch of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Ichi_Software" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nippon Ichi Software&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gust_Co._Ltd." rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to Gust when Neptune was poisoned it was her who created the antidote thus her being removed also meant that this part had to be rewritten&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nisa was largely unimpressive and didn't leave much impact but a couple of character's background had to be re-written with her removal which we'll get back to later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Missing DLC Characters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while optional in the original game the 2 DLC Characters, Red and 5pb. (likewise named from their companies, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Entertainment" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Red Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5pb." rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;5pb.&lt;/a&gt;) both of whcih more focused on IF than Neptune&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with Red she was looking to build her harem of "Wifeys" (english-fied version of waifu?) and targeted IF first. despite being defeated she kept trying to make IF, Compa and Neptune her Wifeys which always lead to a battle and her defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with 5pb it starts off with her being shy about singing in front of people until IF find her and after a number of encounters builds up her confidences. 5pb also is shown to have a demon and angel side to her when she was contemplating stealing Neptune's puddling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Re;birth the DLC characters are Histoire, Plutia and Peashy however the last 2 don't have any storylines associated with them (like why they have crossed to another dimension) while Histoire's "story" can more or less be the main plot as the DLC doesn't add her to the party until she is released (the later 2 are unlocked in chapter 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Substories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the original game there were also other small substories consisting of a scene. some of these poked fun at other games such as Neptune, Compa and IF making comments on a Mario Cart like racing event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Nisa's substoires involved her meeting with the Large Breast Loving Brothers however in the original game the Brothers were bandits. after getting into some trouble with monsters Nisa saves them after they ridicule her of her lack of breasts. when they question why Nisa did this after they ridiculed her, in her usual fashion Nisa boasts about her strong sense of justice and will always help those in need. moved by this the Brothers then turn over a new leaf. as Nisa is mission from Re;Birth the Brother's background was rewrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of Nisa's substories involved her helping a couple of people who were being chased by a Demon which was revealed to be a pissed off Lady White Heart who wanted to kill them for making fun of her chest size. Nisa calmed Lady White Heart down but when the people she was chasing thanked Nisa while at the same time making fun of her chest size (calling her pimple nipples if i recall) prompting Nisa to do a 180 and aid Lady White Heart to kill them (not sure if they were killed or just badly beaten).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another substory involved Lady Blanc and Noire both going to a convention in Lastation and seeing one another but not recognizing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Story Arcs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the game mechanic in the original game where you could only traverse between continents when they were close the plot was broken up to be played in almost any order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before getting the Keyfragment each nation had 2 Arcs. i says 2 because Leanbox was 2 distinctive plots but when i played i first went to Lastation and was forced to stop helping Chian and then went to Lowee (the continent cloest at the time) and was forced to stop that until i did Leanbox's first arc before returning to Lastion and getting the Keyfragment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastions 2 Arcs were more or less the same with Avanir taking over Lastion, Noire feigning amnesia to lean why Neptune was there, helping Chian for the expo and fighting the CPU Breaker Avanir created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't remember much of Lowee's Arcs but i think it was still similar as the CG on Blanc with a book in Re;Birth is also in the original game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first arc of Leanbox in the original game was more or less the same minus Vert joining the party and getting a Keyfragment. the second Arc was about Vert working her hardest to earn back the faith of her people after being lazy in the first Arc however was overheating alot (the X-Box 360 Overheating Problems when it was released) and being rescued by Neptune's Team (primary because IF was worried).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Quartet Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original game each weapon was on each continent but broken into 4, found at the end of 4 different dungeons which were all "kill the boss at the end" types so you had to go through 16 dungeons before being able to get to Celestia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also after remaking the 4 weapons Neptune leaves the party in an attempt to face Arfoire alone (having regained her memories) forcing IF, Compa, Gust and Nisa to fight her when they try and stop her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Re;Birth the weapons aren't broken and get remade into weapons that better suit the CPU. this also means that the CPUs didn't force the weapons into their sockets. also in the Original game the gateway worked so there was no need for the party to get the Basilicon's help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the original game the acquisition of these weapons didn't coincide with each nation having to deal with Fake CPUs and thus Lady Blanc's 3 sizes was never blurted out during a quiz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Guild&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the original game the Guide was made up of people who were born in one nation but worshiped another's CPU. generally these people were looked down upon by others so IF's affiliation with the Guide was kept hidden for much of the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CPU's joining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the original game the CPU's were optional, only required to get the True End. in order to get them using Gust's hidden ability to show the national share levels one needed to increase the shares for one nation in order to trigger an event which lead to Neptune, Compa and IF fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IF x Vert&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF's and Vert's relationship is much more expanded on in Re;Birth than it is in the original game, most likely because of how the CPU's are optional. in Re;Birth we see events such as Vert joining the party when they leave Leanbox stating she can't live without her Iffy, Vert using IF as her "warmer" in Lowee (placing the warmers IF gave her in her endowments before returning to her Iffy) and IF "dying" when everyone tried to fit into the portal device to transport them to Celestia with Vert, purposely, squeezing in with IF and smoothing her within her breasts. (to be honest i loved all these Shoujo Ai/Yuri moments between them. great improvement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overlord Momus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original game Overload Momus did not exists, same same in Re;Birth, however Arfoire never creates it. instead spreads the rumor that the CPU's fled Celestia when Overlord Momus appeared and destroyed it while also spreading news that the Overlord would descend from Celestia and the CPU's, now weakened, will not be able to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Re;Birth Overload Momus takes the form of CFW.Arfoire from &lt;em&gt;Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk. II&lt;/em&gt; (and i assume Re;Birth 2 as from what i have seen i don't see that the plot has changed), the form of the Deity of Sin Afoire takes when ASIC succeeds in resuecting her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7LiJ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7LiJ.png" alt="CFW.Afoire"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOS.Afoire, the Deity of Sin's true form, also appears in Re;Birth as a couple of Colosseum battles such as Delphinus (who too appeared in Mk. II's Colosseum as a palette swap of of DOS.Afoire however was a different pallet swap to Re;Birth's Delphinus)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Afoire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the original game it's revealed that Afoire was the True Goddess until she got tired of the job and split her power, and Gamindustri into 4, creating the CPUs and giving full control of the world to Histoire. later however she wanted it all back and reclaim her spot as the True Goddess and turned on Histoire and sparked the Console Wars so she could reclaim her powers from the CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Re;Birth it's revealed that Afoire was just a regular human who fought along side the Hero Quartet when they fought the True Goddess who was evil. when the True Goddess was defeated her power was split into 4 and Arfoire raised the CPUs herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is also initially suspected that Arfoire was corrupted by the True Goddess's power she copied from her during the battle and sought to become the new True Goddess however in Re;Birth's true end Nepture suspected that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Arfoire wanted to become the True Goddess so she could better raise the CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Endings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 Endings, Normal and True, also are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Original Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never got the Normal Ending in the original game however compared to Re;Birth's normal ending i can assume they would be different as one of the requirements of the True End in the original game was having all the CPU's (shares didn't count)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; After defeating Afoire and escaping Celestia the CPU's realize they still have alot of work to do as Afoire's Enemy Disks are still active and all over the world. in order to make their job easier they sacrifice their HDDs making them regular humans and ridding the world of monsters for good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Re;Birth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Afoire is defeated and Histoire visits each nations to see how the CPUs are doing finishing with Planeptune where she joins Neptune, Compa and IF in eating pudding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Afoire is defeated but tries to destroy Celestia. with the CPU's exhausted everyone goes to flee yet Neptune remains hoping to save Afoire with everyone having escaped but prays for Afoire to be saved too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Year later Histoire states that while everyone escaped Celestia was suspected to have been destroyed in the explosion, Neptune and Afoire with it, as the gateway no longer worked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;after visiting the other nations to see how the CPUs were doing she visits Planeptune. while IF and Compa are talking about Neptune, low and behold Neptune falls through Compa's roof revealing that Celestia wasn't destroyed but instead just the gateway and that she fell from the sky because she was flying around in HDD and got hungry and reverted back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neptune also introduces Afoire who was saved (and looks very different now not looking like some witch). Afoire apologies to Histoire about the trouble she has caused and voes to make up for it until the end of her life while Compa and IF warmly welcomes Neptune home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The CPU Candidates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if one got the Shares up to a certain level for Planeptune, Lastation and Lowee they can get plans to unlock Nepgear, Uni, Ram and Rom. to actually unlock them one had to get the items and the shares to 35% for the CPU Candidate's nation (which stills fall into the requirements for Re;Birth's True End which is 0% for Other Shares and all 4 nations having atleast 20%). following their unlocks there is a scene which Histoire says that they are born from the accumulation of shares with each CPU posting on their blogs about their new sister(s) (with Vert expressing how she's depressed that she didn't get one but will still work hard for Leanbox)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since i never got the normal ending in Re;Birth with any of the CPU Candidates unlocked i can only assume their appearance in the normal end is similar to the True End in which it appeared their small segment are injected in the scene with some differences as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; with Nepgear she has taken over her sister's work since Neptune didn't return from Celestia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however how the world is formed in Re;Birth still makes it incompatible with the 2nd Hyperdimension shown in the other Re;Birth games and &lt;em&gt;Megadimension Neptunia VII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I thought that this was just a funny little coincidence that Little Kuriboh picked up on and made a pun out of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then, I looked up the actual names of the Egyptian God Cards on the Yu-Gi-Oh wikia:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Obelisk_the_Tormentor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Obelisk the Tormentor&lt;/a&gt; |     &#12458;&#12505;&#12522;&#12473;&#12463;&#12398;&#24040;&#31070;&#20853; (lit.

That... actually makes way more sense, because Osiris is an Egyptian God in real life. So, was Slifer an intentional reference to Roger Slifer made by the official translators?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I notice that most of the other languages use &quot;Slifer&quot; as well (including French, German, Italian, Spanish, etc.), and only the Chinese and Korean translations use &quot;Osiris&quot;. What happened here? Why did the translators make this decision?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47244">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The name Osiris was changed to Slifer by 4Kids employee Sam Murakami, possibly due to religious symbol/reference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Slifer#Tributes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A god card in the &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh!&lt;/em&gt; Trading Card Game, originally named Sky Dragon of Osiris (&#12458;&#12471;&#12522;&#12473;&#12398;&#22825;&#31354;&#31452; Oshirisu no Tenk&#363;ry&#363;), was renamed "Slifer the Sky Dragon" after Slifer by 4Kids Entertainment employee Sam Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which sourced &lt;a href="http://alonefancryinginthewilderness.blogspot.com/2012/02/meet-roger-slifer.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the interview with Roger Slifer himself&lt;/a&gt; where he answered with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for Slifer the Sky Dragon, despite the rumors on the web, I did not name that character after myself, even though I was a producer on &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh&lt;/em&gt; at the time. What happened was this: Another 4KIDS employee, Sam Murakami, was our liaison with the producer of the cards. Some names of the cards had to be changed because there was concern their names would be considered demonic or sacrilegious or something here in the states. It never made much sense to me, but when you're broadcasting here in America, it's something that has to be accommodated. Anyway, Sam renamed a bunch of those characters after people on staff at 4KIDS. It just so happened that the one he named after me happened to be a "god" card and much more prominent than the others in the series. I attribute it to the cosmic forces in the universe trying to balance things for me being made a demon in &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider&lt;/em&gt;. And again, just to set the record straight, I wasn't even aware of it until after the names on the cards had been changed and it was too late to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just another case of censorship that affects some cards (also refer to an unanwered question: &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/29806/was-kazuki-takahashi-involved-in-the-modifications-made-in-yu-gi-oh-for-reasons"&gt;Was Kazuki Takahashi involved in the modifications made in Yu-Gi-Oh! for reasons of censorship?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

He has a sad history of death and mistreatment that I won't treat here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the Haku's peculiarity is that although he looks/behaves/dresses like a woman, he is a man. But not all sources agree with this, so... Is Haku a man or a woman? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there a reason for the first part in my spoiler? Or is it just a plot device?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If your answer contains something that appears or is explained after the Bridge battle with Team 7 (as far as Haku is concerned), please use a spoiler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="505">&lt;p&gt;I think Haku is actually a woman.&lt;br&gt;
However, she tells Naruto she is a man (I think in chapter 21).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever may be the case, &lt;em&gt;I believe&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;she does not care&lt;/strong&gt;. What she &lt;strong&gt;cares most about&lt;/strong&gt; is being able to serve Zabuza (if she can serve him, she is wanted in this world). For this, she sees herself as a tool, her only purpose being to see that Zabuza accomplishes his objectives (I believe it is in chapter 29 that she explains this to Naruto). She also tells Naruto that if she fails Zabuza she'd rather be dead, because she's lost her purpose.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, I believe that whichever may be the case, it is ultimately irrelevant to her/him, since:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tools do not have genders.&lt;br&gt;
As such, Haku does not have a gender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="506">&lt;p&gt;I do not think that Haku was considered as a woman is considered a spoiler. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, they discover that only 1 episode after Team 7 met him. I can guarantee for sure that Haku is a man. Despite what other sources probably say, there are plenty of men in real life who look like women (Justin Bieber is good example). What I cannot tell you is what was the perspective of Zabuza for him (if he was just a Friend or something "&lt;strong&gt;Else&lt;/strong&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say this only because the one who told Naruto that significant detail was Haku himself, so there isn't a lot of room for mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Haku portrays the physical and emotional traits of a female even though she tries hard to be a male &lt;em&gt;(Zabuza's tool)&lt;/em&gt;. Secondly, Naruto called her sir, keep in mind that they also call Tsunade &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so that does not really indicate gender. My third reason is that as JNat also says, she does not care, when Zabuza found her, she was weak, being referred to as a boy or behaving like one no doubt made her seem stronger in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Homura's witch's labyrinth was inside of her soul gem, and didn't actually occupy and physical space. How, then, were all of the magical girls and everybody else brought into her soul gem? How did everybody that was shown in her labyrinth get into it in the first place? Wouldn't they have to physically go there and get into her soul gem somehow? Were they just teleported there by Homura since she &quot;willed them to be there&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26430">&lt;p&gt;It's implied that Homura wished for them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Homura questions how people came to be trapped inside the barrier, Kyubey explains they made an adjustment that allowed things to be "invited" inside. Images of the familiars appearing in the real world behind Mami, Kyoko, Hitomi, and Kyosuke are shown, &lt;a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Episode_4" rel="nofollow"&gt;implying they abducted the victims and pulled them into the barrier&lt;/a&gt;. Kyubey explains that the people trapped in Homura's barrier are people that Homura subconsciously wished for. Futhermore her barrier could also invite the Law of Cycles itself, which would allow the incubators to observe what causes the disappearance of magical girls when they run out of magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Rebellion/Synopsis#Part_D" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rebellion/Synopsis - Part D (2nd Paragraph)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i do not understand however is why Episode 4 is linked. I suspect that because in Episode 4 we see Hitomi being controlled with a Witch's Kiss to where the Witch Elly and her Labyrinth was this could imply that Homura as a Witch wished for others to be with her by sending "invites" in the form of Witch Kisses (to put them in a tranced state similar to Hitomi and Elly's other victims) and her Familiars tracked them down while the Incubators allowed them to enter Homura's Barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Isolation Field is meant to isolate Homura's Soul Gem from external influences but it still allows her to call out to the &lt;em&gt;Law of Cycles&lt;/em&gt; which is what the Incubators were after, seeing what happens to a Soul Gem in a controlled environment (and they only learned about the Law of Cycles after confirming the existence of Witches by isolating a Soul Gem turning black) so with that said i do not not how the Familiars were getting out but it's possible the Incubators were allowing only them to leave&lt;/p&gt;

However, Kid Buu was the final antagonist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antagonist's power is generally adjusted to be comparable to the protagonist they are fighting. Since Ultimate Gohan is stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Goku, they had him fight Super Buu. Same goes for Vegito, who fought the strongest iteration of Buu. Just like you said, despite Beerus being stronger than the rest of the antagonists after, they did use a greater amount of power against Goku and co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after watching the movie, I personally believe there is sufficient reason to believe that &lt;b&gt;Jiren&lt;/b&gt; might be stronger( At least the version of him where he releases his dormant power). There are several reasons why I believe this to be true:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Tournament of Power lays emphasis on the fact that Goku surpasses the Gods and manages to overcome Jiren. This was constantly laid emphasis on during the course of the tournament while he was Master UI. Jiren was able to go toe to toe with this iteration of Goku and also come out on Top in terms of raw power. When the trailers and initial summary of the movie first came out, it was stated that Goku was almost reaching the level of a God and Vegeta was catching up(This makes sense considering the fact that it was established at the end of DBS that Goku does not have access to Ultra Instinct anymore).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broly as a Super Saiyan was no doubt stronger than Super Saiyan Blue Goku and Vegeta. However, there isn't a long enough fight to determine the exact difference. Goku and Vegeta would have definitely grown stronger compared to the T.O.P. However, they were using forms 20 times stronger against Jiren who was nowhere near full power while fighting these two. Also, Golden Frieza managed to last against an agitated Broly who was looking to kill. He barely lasted for a second against Jiren who took him out with a glare and a single punch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the tournament of power, it was more or less implied that the only way to defeat Jiren was for Goku to master Ultra Instinct. If Goku and Vegeta could've defeated Jiren with fusion, it would break the entire plot and the entire struggle against Jiren wouldn't make sense. This is because Vegeta had absolutely no problem working with Goku and doing everything to win. It was stated that Fusion was allowed and they both saw a potara fused a character a while back. Not even Whis or anyone stated Goku and Vegeta would be able to win this fight fused. So I do believe Jiren at the time was stronger than Vegito, hence Gogeta(Definitely when he releases his dormant power). SSJ Broly had a disadvantage against SSJ Gogeta. LSSJ Broly could barely hold his own against SSJB Gogeta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, at the end of the movie, Goku compares Broly's power to that of Beerus. However, Goku and Vegeta mentioned that Jiren was the strongest they ever faced when they fought him, implying Jiren was &gt; Beerus.(Goku says a suppressed Jiren's punch was the strongest he's ever faced, Vegeta says he hasn't felt a level of energy like this before). V-Jump magazine had an article where Beerus comments that Goku has surpassed him after achieving UI, which you can see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herms98/status/971662109892263936" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Battle of Gods arc, SSJG Goku was said to be stronger than Vegito. If you compare the difference between SSJ3 and SSJG, the power is significant indeed. However, the difference in power is a lot less if you were to compare SSJB + Kaioken * 20 To UI Omen, the difference in power is a lot more significant and Mastered Ultra Instinct is substantially stronger than the two. Since the potara multiplier is fixed, I believe MUI Goku would still be stronger&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the next arc of the manga states that Goku was still attempting to master UI as he tells Vegeta that he hasn't been able to tap into the transformation even once after the tournament of power. So if the series were to resume, Goku might most likely tap into this form against a stronger Antagonist that even Jiren and Broly. There is promotional material with regard to Broly's strength claiming how he is one of the strongest and they say his level of destruction might be greater than that of a God of Destruction. The source for this can be seen &lt;a href="https://dragonballsuper-france.fr/dragon-ball-super-broly-une-puissance-destructrice-au-dela-de-celle-dun-dieu-de-la-destruction/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, there is no legitimate valid source indicating Broly to be stronger than Jiren. DBS did something new in the series by having Goku achieve two transformations in 1 arc and at the end of the arc, not be able to tap into it anymore. I think this on its own is sufficient evidence as to how Over Powered this iteration of Goku is and why the plot decided to take this transformation away before bringing characters even stronger. Plus, Whis's training is mainly focused on making them achieve the form. If Goku did achieve it, he would technically have completed Whis's training which is necessarily not the case based on the beginning of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="51264">&lt;p&gt;There is no conclusive evidence in my opinion but, I think it's Jiren because of this mainly, the Broly movie apparently takes place shortly after the tournament of power, and Freezer was able to resist being beated by Broly for 1 hour, when in the tournament of power Freezer was seriously damaged by Toppo, who is at least 2 levels behind Jiren full power (Toppo is weaker than Jiren not using full power). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside of that, Goku thinks Broly "might be stronger than Beerus" which in my opinion means he's close to Beerus's power (since Goku isnt sure) when Jiren is said to be stronger than gods of destructions, when Jiren was almost a match for Goku mastered ultra instinct (a state to which all the gods of destructions almost vowed to, they stand up when Goku transformed as a sign of respect or admiration, like admitting it was a state superior to them, Beerus had to ask Wiss about Goku's power because it was beyond his comprehension, Beerus sweated to Goku Ultra Instinct Omen which was almost a match for Jiren not in full power and the other gods of destructions were surprised etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we could get an answer in some of the Dragon Ball Heroes versions which wouldnt be an answer for the canonical universe, but an answer for one of the Dragon Ball versions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School Days&lt;/strong&gt; is the main &amp;amp; first game in the series. It was remade in &lt;strong&gt;School Days HQ&lt;/strong&gt; with updated graphics and additional uncensored scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer Days&lt;/strong&gt; takes place during the same time period, but in an alternate universe. The story is told from the perspective of Setsuna Kiyoura. It was remade as &lt;strong&gt;Shiny Days&lt;/strong&gt; and an English translation of this has been announced recently. The original Shiny Days came bundled with bonus games &lt;strong&gt;Ahoge Battle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Strip Battle Days&lt;/strong&gt; which haven't been confirmed/unconfirmed by JASTUSA yet whether they will be in the English version or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross Days&lt;/strong&gt; is a story that takes place at the same time as School Days, but with a different cast. There is no English version yet, although there was a trial CD at one stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Island Days&lt;/strong&gt; is a VN/Tower Defence Game, where weapons picked up in the main story line are used to defend yourself during the tower-defence stage. It seems to just be a spin-off unplaced in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Alternative Versions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of writing, only School days has an animated version, but Summer Days and Cross Days have small manga adaptions - An anthology and a two-volume series respectively. There are light novels of all three games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There doesn't seem to be much secondary merchandise for Island Days.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought ESP is an ability to move and destroy things that exist using mind control, not to produce a new skin and flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50201">&lt;p&gt;In the manga, it is explained that the power that gives Tetsuo his psychokinetic abilities is trying to break free, as his body is no longer enough to contain it. To compensate for this, his body is trying to absorb material from all around him. As for why he could produce additional matter, the power trying to break free might be partially converting energy into additional mass during his breakdown, allowing him to generate additional flesh. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="15321" Title="How does Obito have two Sharingans if Madara took one?" Body="&lt;p&gt;If Madara took Obito's left eye, how come he has both Sharingans? (Chapter 683, page 15) Did Obito replace the one he lost with Kakashi's Sharingan, like a trade?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="15325">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obito had his Right eye Kamui Sharingan and Madaras Rinnegan in his
  left socket. Madara snatched Kakashis Kamui Sharingan and used it to
  enter Kamui Dimension and retrieve his Rinnegan. He was successful and
  Black Zetsu possessed Obitos right body half, which was eyeless until
  Madara popped Kakashis Sharingan in. Obito got both his eyes back in
  that moment, but B Zetsu was using the Obitos right half and used
  Kakashis eye to get himself and Madara out of the dimension..  It was
  mentioned, but it was easyly possible to miss.. I thought for quite a
  while that Obito didn't have both of his eyes until it was cleared up
  to me, that the Obitos right eye was never touched by madara.. thus
  giving him both eyes. Why did Madara pop Kakashis Kamui eye back? I
  don't know... Lets just say for plot, because he could have just
  crushed it. I'd assume he didn't consider Obito a threat anymore and
  wanted the MS Sharingan as backup for whatever reason.. It really
  caused a stir here when those chapters came around&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="15333">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because Madara gave him the Sharingan he had taken from Kakashi back when he took the Rinnegan Obito had in his left eye socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In chapter 674, page 14, Madara takes Kakashi's Sharingan eye (Obito's left eye):  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qwGI.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qwGIm.png" alt="Naruto chapter 674 page 14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 675, page 10, Madara switches his left eye - currently holding Obito's left eye - for the Rinnegan Obito has in his left eye socket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mp6O.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mp6Om.png" alt="Naruto chapter 675 page 10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same chapter, he lets Black Zetsu take control of Obito's left side. In chapter 676, page 2, we see that Obito now has both of his Sharingan, though he is not in control of his body:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzKwx.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzKwxm.png" alt="Naruto chapter 676 page 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 679, page 6, Black Zetsu leaves Obito's body to join Kaguya:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has been mostly destroyed by a war. We don't really know if it is a war between humans or between humans and aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of sora no woto seems to be destroyed between 2000-2010, because of several allusions to this era during the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't know much because I suspect this series was supposed to be part of a bigger multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is that this series has a tie-in with occult gakuin as they were two series from the same anime no chikara TV block. Basically, the story of occult gakuin is about someone from the future that comes back in the past to avoid the apocalypse that happened in his time period.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14214">&lt;p&gt;I'm still learning english, but this is what I understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apocalypse is related to the legend that Yumina describes in chapter 12. It could have been the great war against one angel (it appears on chapter 7 partially, you could see black wings in the windows- this happens when Felicia remember her past). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enemy was extremely strong, even a takemikazuchi was not enough to fight against the "angel". I am not sure if it&#180;s an alien or maybe advanced technology from that time. The "angel" uses a laser to destroy a city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world look likes today, some buildings without great technology, the only remarkable thing was takemikazuchi. Chapter 7 has more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It makes sense that kanji appears in the series because the alphabets are substitutions for Japanese kana, the collective term for hiragana and katakana, which is a part of the Japanese writing system (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter_Alphabet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But is kanji part of the their writing system besides their unique alphabets, or the purpose is to let the readers understand what it says?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xa7Os.jpg&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IMXjW.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="28884" Title="Is Bakuman realistic?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Does Bakuman explain the life of a mangaka realistically? Is the way shounen Jack works the exact same as jump?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28888">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'll highlight the main points made in &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2010-10-15" rel="noreferrer"&gt;this article by Justin Sevakis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, the thing is, Bakuman. presents a very romanticized, very clean-cut, idyllic perspective on the "manga industry." And it works in that sense - it's goal, as a manga itself, is to make you care about the dreams of these young Shonen archetypes and hope that they will achieve all their hopes and wishes through hard work and many tough battles - but it is far from a realistic portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'll admit that Bakuman. gets a lot of the specifics right, and it succeeds at presenting an otherwise dry, self-referential premise in an entertaining way, but it is far from realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And, the other thing is, I dunno how many conventions you've been to recently, but take a good, honest gander anywhere around Artist Alley and you're likely to find several eager young artists proudly hawking their most recent Graphic Novel. Granted you won't see as much of this stuff at anime-focused cons like Otakon or whatever, but if you're ever in the vicinity of any all-purpose Nerd Convention near your home town, you'll be able to walk by dozens of booths rented by local artists promoting their self-published work. Essentially, there are a lot of people out there who are dying to sell their own graphic novels, outside of the manga realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another point made on this matter is&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuman" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jason Thompson referred to Bakuman as "a love letter to the manga industry done in old-school shonen manga style." He felt that while it can be "text-heavy" on the process of making manga, it is ultimately a "heroic story of self-improvement, friendship and striving to succeed." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for your other question, Shounen Jump is pretty much the same as Shounen Jack and it was only renamed for copyright issues. As mentioned in an interview with Takeshi Obata, the mangaka of Bakuman&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ashirogi.Bakuman/posts/315923248488238" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ohba Sensei creates characters who have realistic personalities. When I draw them, I slightly reference real-life people that I&#8217;ve seen in this industry and exaggerate their qualities to turn them into manga characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The whole time I was working on Bakuman, I felt like I was drawing about my everyday life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Dragon Ball Resurrection of Freezer, Goku, when transformed in Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, is almost killed by a laser beam from Sorbet. Now how could this happen? Was his ki so low even when he was a SSGSS? Later in the Dragon Ball Super series this seems to be corrected because he isn't transformed when he is hit. But then again, I don't know which is the version that counts, supposedly the manga is over the movie and series but between something that happens in the movie and series I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the question of this topic is: can a transformed Saiyan (Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan God, etc.) lower his ki to base-human level when transformed? Was this just a mistake or what?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34262">&lt;p&gt;There are kind of multiple issues wrapped into one here. Firstly, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can a super saiyan their ki to the point that it is human level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No that is impossible. Why? Because it takes a great amount of energy to undergo and sustain a physical transformation. If you drop your ki below a certain point. You revert to your base form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Goku death by beam? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes that can also happen. It seems almost impossible in theory but remember saiyans are in fact humanoid aliens and as such they can fall vulnerable to being shot in the back if they lower their ki sense. Whis warns Goku of this when he tells him during their training and in the manga that he gets too overconfident easily and lowers his guard and that is his weakness which is the polar opposite of Vegeta who is too on-guard and thus gets slowed down. (I can link the manga panel later). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is. Goku was confident of victory which is why he was able to be shot. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37371">&lt;p&gt;The comment marked as answer is WRONG. Re-watch the Cell Saga, especially after Goku and Gohan leave the time chamber. Whether or not their powered down super saiyan form is to the level of a "human" is debatable, but the characters did mention Goku and Gohan seemed like normal people. Later on, we saw that for Gohan to get to SSj2, was to make SSj1 feel like your normal state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*removed the word Necessary. There are the DBZ encyclopedia books out there, it said you needed more anger to reach SSJ2 from SSj1-so I apologize for that.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="53016" Title="Which is the first D-Mail?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I think the common explanation for the shift in timelines is that &quot;In episode 1, Okabe sends the 1st D-mail, changing the world to the Alpha world line where Kurisu lives instead of dying.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, the mail Okabe sends is just an ordinary mail (have they even invented the D-Mail yet?), it is directed to Daru, and it only contains information from the past that anyone could have witnessed. How does this message turn into a D-Mail and tip off SERN?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53021">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Answer edited to fit what was discussed in the comments as well)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether or not the message Okabe sent is a D-Mail isn't something he has control over, at least not at the beginning of the series. The conditions just happened to be right when he sent the message that ended up becoming the first D-Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First condition/coincidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are told early in the story that Daru was experimenting on the microwave, having his own cellphone wired to it instead of the dedicated one, when Okabe sent him the message. It is safe to assume that he was trying to get the microwave running with its door open, because it is one of the key conditions to sending a D-Mail (learnt in episode 3), and nothing would have happened otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out that Daru tells us about his experiments on the microwave in the second timeline, not in the first one, which is true. However, given that the first ever D-Mail was complete gibberish and was dismissed by Daru, we can speculate that the livelihood of the group was not impacted at all by it.
The only impact this D-Mail really had is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The SERN caught on it, which eventually led to them developping a functionning time machine as well marking the start of the "Time War", and finally to Suzuha's abrupt landing on the rooftop of the conference center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would then be safe to assume that the group's actions, from the D-Mail being received and dismissed by Daru to Okabe wandering alone in the evacuated area, haven't been impacted at all and that therefore Daru has been conducting the same experiments on the microwave at around the same time in these two timelines.
This is only speculation, but it is realistic and coherent with the rest of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second condition/coincidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the show you learn about the second conditon for sending D-Mails which explains why they can only be sent during a certain period of the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The shop owner recently placed a cathode ray TV just in the right spot below their microwave. This is the reason why D-Mails weren't happening before, and can now only happen when the shop owner turns it on and it fires electrons into the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we assume that Daru was conducting experiments on the microwave around that time it is also safe to assume that the second condition was fulfilled, as otherwise Daru probably wouldn't have been conducting these experiments in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Because, if it&#8217;s the same soul basically being reborn over and over&#8230;how exactly were Madara and Sasuke able to be alive at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvzi8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvzi8.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43513">&lt;p&gt;The official translation uses the word: &#8220;vessel&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Naruto pointed out after the whole reincarnation scenario was presented to him, he was Naruto, and not Asura, which was true. Rather, he was a vessel for Asura, or at least the essence, or the will of Asura. So, he will have the will, and by extension, the same fate as the originals and the reincarnations before him. (although Naruto does break the cycle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, Masashi gets a little bit vague as to what this actually does for our heroes. He implies that the reincarnations are imbued with the power of the originals, although this is never stated outright. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to how Madara and Sasuke could both be inheritors at the same time, once Madara uses the Rinne Rebirth on himself, he doesn&#8217;t actually become a vessel for Indra once again, but rather is already powerful from when he was. As Kabuto stated, he is a copy of when he was in his prime, and that Madara did have the soul of Indra within him. So, even if he wasn&#8217;t necessarily a vessel during the war, he was very like his former, vessel self, they don&#8217;t both have Indra residing within them. &lt;/p&gt;

They don't seem to be translated lyrics anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="31327" Title="What is Naruto's second element?" Body="&lt;p&gt;After a long time of hard work, most ninja get a second Nature element. While Naruto's first one is wind, I don't recall his second one being mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What was Naruto's second nature ability?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31328">&lt;p&gt;Naruto's natural affinity is &lt;strong&gt;Wind Release&lt;/strong&gt;, which he learned from &lt;em&gt;Asuma Sarutobi&lt;/em&gt; to flow into his weapons to increase their offensive might. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;em&gt;Six Paths Sage Mode&lt;/em&gt;, Naruto can utilize all &lt;strong&gt;Five Nature Transformations&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as &lt;strong&gt;Yin&#8211;Yang Release&lt;/strong&gt;. He can make perfect use of the latter to revitalise life-forces, heal whomever he touches, and even restore missing organs. This ability, however, has its limits as he was unable to fully restore &lt;em&gt;Might Guy's&lt;/em&gt; leg after his use of &lt;em&gt;Night Guy&lt;/em&gt;, or save &lt;em&gt;Obito Uchiha&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Kaguya's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;All-Killing Ash Bones&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With chakra from the &lt;em&gt;Tailed Beasts&lt;/em&gt;, Naruto can also use &lt;em&gt;Kekkei Genkai&lt;/em&gt; such as the &lt;strong&gt;Magnet Release&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lava Release&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Boil Release&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Shukaku&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Son Gok&#363;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Koku&#333;&lt;/em&gt;, respectively.

</answer><answer Id="48907">&lt;p&gt;Every ninja has at least two elements; Kekkei Genkai and Tota excluded as those have elements that combine to make a release form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naruto's second element while training with Yamato and Kakashi before learning sage mode, my guess would be water. Water beats Fire, wind beats lightning which is why in their clash on the rooftop the Rasengan did more damage than the Chidori, putting aside the fact the Chidori was meant to be a one-hit kill as lightning enhances your speed and striking power while wind enables you to cut better as with Asuma's knives cloaked in wind chakra.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="53603">&lt;p&gt;I believe that Rasengan is a wind technic. To learn Rasenshuriken, Naruto has to focus on life energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I believe there are two basic elements; one which Sasuke hiers the eyes which includes lightning and fire techniques, and Naruto's which is the body. He has more control over his physical strength, but if Naruto's second ability would be anything, it would be the life energy.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="15470">&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to explain your question. Hamura never sealed any part of the juubi in himself, he was sealed entirely in hagoromo. Also, I don't know if you're talking about the anime or the manga. If anime, no, you haven't seen the full power of the juubi yet, as the resurrection was incomplete due to lack of the hachibi and kyuubi. In the manga, its full power is shown. &lt;/p&gt;

They are very similar in appearence and possibly&#10;  behavior, but their underlying character reasoning is different. Being&#10;  silent for the sake of being silent vs being cool&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a problem placing her as a dandere because she sometimes acts playful as the image above (not antisocial). Am I correct considering her dandere ?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13935">&lt;p&gt;Yes, she can be considered a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dandere" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dandere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A dandere character is one who is normally quiet and silent, possibly to the point of coming across as emotionless at times, but will suddenly become talkative and sweet and cute when alone with the right person if they manage to push the right button to get them to pour their heart out, revealing that they're actually just shy. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A dandere will be more or less a normal person, but, will not talk unless spoken to/required to. They will avoid talking because of their shyness, but if need be, they will speak. Also, a dandere tends to feel more power in numbers. If they're with a group that they're comfortable with, then the shyness factor of said dandere will very likely decrease if another, unfamiliar person is introduced at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first otaku meeting of &lt;strong&gt;Kirino&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ruri&lt;/strong&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;strong&gt;Kuroneko&lt;/strong&gt;) was silent and passed her time with her cell phone, but later when &lt;strong&gt;Saori&lt;/strong&gt; introduced them to each other, Ruri was talking (quarreling) with Kirino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruri was comfortable with &lt;strong&gt;Kyosuke&lt;/strong&gt;. She was talking normally with him and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; confessed her love to Kyosuke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also talks and enjoy herself when she is with members of Saori's circle and with school club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are, however, only some examples of her behavior. Throughout the entire series, there are many occasions where her character matches the description of a Dandere as stated above.&lt;/p&gt;

The world of void is infinity and Jiren's mere presence caused infinity to shake and even when Goku emerged during his UI transformation, it was stated that the world of void is shaking. I think when their power is as enormous to ripple across infinity, such rules wouldn't apply to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was stated that time itself meant nothing against Jiren's strength so I don't see why a rule like the no flight would apply to him when he is at the level of strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;*An alternate explanation: We see android 17 use his energy to create a form of footing and he stands on that to eliminate Kakunsa. The special force or special gravity responsible for stopping flight, should have in theory stopped that layer of footing from existing but it didn't. So in other words, android 17 could've sat on that for as long as he wanted and it would appear even as though he was floating. Jiren's energy is obviously a lot superior to android 17 so whatever special forces of gravity responsible to prevent flight aren't strong enough to hold Jiren in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The killing will only result in the god of death dying if they kill someone who is going to kill an individual the god of death &lt;strong&gt;favors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31271">&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, there is another rule which states this even more clearly.  Only if a shinigami &lt;strong&gt;intentionally&lt;/strong&gt; extends someone's life they die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule LVIII:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) By manipulating the death of a human that has influence over another human's life, that human's original life span can sometimes be lengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If a god of death intentionally does the above manipulation to effectively lengthen a human's life span, the god of death will die, but even if a human does the same, the human will not die.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In various episodes, Rin receives mysterious letters attached to Lennon (&#12524;&#12494;&#12531;), a white kitten, offering to reveal the &quot;secret&quot; of this world, in return for completing certain tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who is sending these letters? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is the &quot;secret&quot; these letters are referring to?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fg5wl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What is this &amp;quot;secret?&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3090">&lt;p&gt;I haven't played the visual novel for a long time (8-10 months) but I'll try to answer as precisely as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This "secret of the world" is the key of the anime/visual novel as you may already have noticed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning, spoilers below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret of the world is revealed during Refrain in the visual novel, which is unlocked once you have completed all the other routes (including Rin2, which is basically Rin's route with a choice you can only choose when all the others routes (excluding Refrain of course) are completed, i.e {Komari, Kud, Kurugaya, Haruka, Mio, Rin1} in whatever order, then Rin2, and finally Refrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In refrain, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; you play as Riki who tries to gather Little Busters! "core" members (Rin, Masato, Kengo, Kyousuke) as when they were children to discover finally what the "secret of the world" you've heard of is about. In the last scene of Refrain, Kyousuke reveals that during the class trip, the car in which the Little Busters! members were fell from a cliff and as Riki and Rin were not ready to continue their life alone (they were protected by Kengo and Masato), the other members created an "artificial world" that is basically the first semester repeating again and again, freezing the "real world" in which they are all severely injured. Once Riki and Rin are strong enough to continue their life, the world that was created will disappear, with all the members disappearing one by one until they are the only ones left (you can search "Refrain last scene" on Youtube to see what it looks like). Of course it's Key so you'll get a happy end where Riki and Rin will do a good job and save all of them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your second question, although I think you've already guessed it if you read the spoiler above, the culprit is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kyousuke ; Riki will see him attaching a letter to Lennon's tail, but I'm not sure when exactly, it was during Rin2 or Refrain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that'll answer your questions :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She helped Sakura, by delivering her and Sasuke's daughter, Sarada at Orochimaru's hideout &#8212; as Sakura, while pregnant, had refused to leave Sasuke's side while he was traveling. She also became friends with Sakura, at some point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suigetsu even increased the confusion of Sarada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Sarada requested for Suigetsu's assistance in checking whether Karin is her birth mother or not. Suigetsu found a strand of Karin's DNA in her desk (not knowing that it was Sarada's umbilical cord) and used it to run a test with that of Sarada's, which revealed a perfect match. Some time after Shin's defeat, Karin scolded Suigetsu for touching her belongings, explaining to him that he had used Sakura and Sarada's umbilical cord in the DNA test.&lt;/p&gt;

The use of Haki is to be able to make contact with a Logia type fruit user.  This allows for a "fair" fight (in the sense that one person isn't inherently untouchable).  However, there is no fruit that negates the power of Haki (or at least among the fruits that have been revealed).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="16777">&lt;p&gt;From the other perspective, having Haki only allows for Haki user to make contact (or touch) the Logia. It does not give them any anti-Logia super-effective skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, any Logia can beat any Haki user, as the fight essentially comes down to better skills (unless we go and look for specific combinations)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18995">&lt;p&gt;The only Logia ability that has a proven record of defeating - nay KO'ing Haki users is the &lt;em&gt;Gas-Gas no Mi&lt;/em&gt;, provided it is used with an element of surprise. You would recollect that Ceaser KO'ed both Luffy and Smoker by depriving them of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, we could probably see Logia abilities like hot plasma or gamma ray, which could possibly penetrate Haki.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44707">&lt;p&gt;In a sense, Soru Soru no Mi. It's not logia, but paramecia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other answer already provide how logia can beat haki user but this devil fruit power can make haki useless against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devil fruit user them self aren't automatically immune to haki but the objects with soul fragments inside them are immune to haki attack. Surely homies (objects and animals that have been anthropomorphized by the Soru Soru no Mi) like King Baum can be cut easily with simple sword attack. But with powerful enough soul like Prometheus, a mass of compressed flames, is completely immune to Luffy's busoshoku haki attack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fOWTl.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fOWTl.jpg" alt="Prometheus against luffy&amp;#39;s haki"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powerful as it seems, even Prometheus can get injured by Brook. Supposedly, not because of his haki but because of devil fruit incompatibility. Brook, a soul king, can attack soul directly. &lt;/p&gt;

All the humanoids were girls and had the power to become stronger if they kissed a person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few things I remember: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Humanoids 1-9 (possibly 1-10) were stronger than the rest. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At one point, the main character helps a man and his humanoid escape the city (a forbidden act) which was heavily guarded with a few of the 1-9 humanoids. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The main character's sister had a humanoid that was trying to find it's sister, which turned out to be the main character's humanoid. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry if this is confusing but it's probably the most simple way I can put all this down. I'm 99% the girls were some type of humanoid or something but I'm not 100% if the term in the anime was humanoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23425">&lt;p&gt;Probably &lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/4063/Sekirei"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sekirei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the story was about humanoids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which are called "Sekirei".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All the humanoids were girls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most, but not all (Shiina is male; Homura may also be). Equal-opportunity fanservice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the main character &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generic McProtagonist-kun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;helps a man and his humanoid escape the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shigi with his Sekirei, Kuno.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;the main character's sister had a humanoid that was trying to find her sister which was the main character's humanoid&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;On Episode 6 of &lt;strong&gt;Ao no Exorcist&lt;/strong&gt;, at around 21:30, Principal Mephisto Pheles tells his younger brother, Amaimon, to pass on a message to their other siblings. If the subs were right, it says: &lt;em&gt;&quot;...tell our siblings who are going mad with envy that our youngest brother is being raised under my wing&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVdhd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ao no Exorcist Episode 6&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On episode 23 however, Yukio offers his own &lt;em&gt;Satanic&lt;/em&gt; blood to open the Gehenna gate, and at around 2:40 we can see Mephisto and Amaimon observing the chaos unfolding from above. Being the younger twin, Yukio is technically their youngest brother with their blood - in contrast with their conversation from episode 6. They do not seem shocked by the news that Yukio possesses Satan's blood after all, or they cleverly hid their reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/JqXjy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ao no Exorcist Episode 23&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am asking for clarification, preferably from manga readers: Was Mephisto was really aware of his erroneous statement and was it all really part of his &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; or is this merely a (gasp!) narrative plothole of the anime?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="17104">&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if it's a plot hole but it's definitely a bit dubious. Yukio's body wasn't strong enough for Satan's powers, so they rejected him leaving him a pure human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Satan is still his dad, so I guess he might still have inherited stuff other than demonic powers. Maybe that includes Satan's blood type, assuming Satan has blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren't really any answers in the manga, because the anime goes in its own direction after episode 16 or so, but to answer the question, yes Mephistopheles definitely knew he was the son of Satan but that he had no demonic powers, no he almost certainly wasn't talking about him when he said our youngest brother.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18838">&lt;p&gt;Yukio's body was born to be too weak to control Satan's blue flames. But he is still the son of Satan so of course he will always inherit the blood of satan, just not his power.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="5426" Title="Why do producers translate some anime titles?" Body="&lt;p&gt;A lot of producers these days seem to change the original Japanese name to English alternatives. Why do they do this? Does this add any value to the name of the anime in other countries or is it just that it is easier to read for people outside of japan/otaku society?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because some of the cases are really weird and in my opinion not necessary. An example of this would be &lt;em&gt;&quot;Ace of Diamond&quot;&lt;/em&gt; also known as &lt;em&gt;&quot;Diamond no Ace&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything to gain from translating the title? Also, why don't all series do this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5428">&lt;p&gt;Since you don't specify who is "they" I would like to give some insight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"they" the English Comercializator&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotional/Marketing desition which take into account the public, if the program/title has an extensive fan-base that knows the name by the Japanese title, it would be counter-productive to translating the title and maybe lossing buyers that don't know the "product" by the english title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attractiveness: some titles are more atractive if they have mixed/full english translation, again a marketing move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be others reasons but most of them will boil down to marketing tactics to sell, through the Japanese trademark holders may like to commercialize under a specific name, or, at petition of the author, use a translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"they" the fan&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans most of the time are purist, and call series by the original Japanese pronunciation which in some cases is rather painful (any long/big title almost impossible to pronounce out there?). Short names are also used (ex. PapaKiki) but most of them are stablished by the Japanese fans rather than the english-speakers. Through, some fans knows the title both by the translation and original Japanese, when distributing/discussing the most popular name takes precedence over the other possible uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other cases&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some titles are already in English (or attempt of English), so no translation is made and is pronounced with correct english. Example of this, english-speakers may use &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;Desu N&#333;to&lt;/em&gt; as they would know the correct pronunciation and was what the author tried to convey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this cases, english marketers normally just use the correct english spelling when commercializing, and the only exception I know is &lt;em&gt;'Cardcaptor Sakura'&lt;/em&gt; which was commercialized as &lt;em&gt;'Cardcaptors'&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't seen anything like it in Western media&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18560">&lt;p&gt;You are correct that it is about a rush of timing during the initial broadcast of the series.  The &lt;a href="http://sailormooncrystalfailures.tumblr.com/tagged/compbr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon Crystal&lt;/em&gt; Failures&lt;/a&gt; website is maintaining a log of Toei's initial run screenshots with their Blu-Ray revisions. Toei was running behind from the beginning (it originally announced that &lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon Crystal&lt;/em&gt; would start in summer of 2013, but the release date was pushed back twice: to early 2014, and then it finally did start "airing" in July of 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, anime was made with hand-painted cels, so of course the production companies were careful to paint each one the way they wanted it the first time. Nowadays, most anime is made with CG, so the idea of getting something rough out by the deadline and then going back and tweaking it later has only quite recently emerged (another production change is that anime is now largely not animated by Japanese animators within Japan; it is often animated by Koreans in South Korea.  Another is that anime is less profitable within Japan than it used to be, so cutting corners more visibly in order to cut down costs was not previously common). 
&lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon Crystal&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9709/why-is-sailor-moon-2014-not-airing-on-tv/13849#13849"&gt;not considered profitable enough&lt;/a&gt; for TV broadcast (indeed its viewer numbers have &lt;a href="http://ellephedre.tumblr.com/post/107146770770/crystals-ratings-on-niconico-japan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;sharply crashed&lt;/a&gt; [a drop of 70%] from the number of viewers of the first episode).  This could be another factor in Toei's decision to decrease the artwork quality for subsequent episodes of the initial run and thereby give themselves more time to touch it up afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with you that this is not a common practice in Western media. American cartoon viewers are very particular about the quality.  My friend who is a key-frames animator for &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; told me that there is one animator whose entire job is just to animate the mouth movements, because if the mouth movement does not perfectly match the voice actor's words, the fans generally feel that they cannot suspend disbelief. In contrast, anime in Japanese does not always bother to record the voice actors' voices first before animating, since Japanese fans do not care much whether the mouth movements exactly match. English dubs of anime can sound strange precisely because the script translator, instead of choosing the most natural-sounding English translation for the original sentence, often chooses what he/she thinks the American voice actor can say that will match the animated mouth movements.  The dub voice actors then try to make their syllables match as closely as possible, even to the point of the sentence sounding unnatural in English. The reason is that American viewers are used to watching mouth movements like in &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; and Disney films which are perfectly aligned. Along these lines, if a Western company released a cartoon that was not high-quality at first, it would be very ill-received and ill-reviewed, the show could be abruptly cancelled, and they wouldn't be able to make as much money.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Since the alchemical forces being manipulated are not human in origin, but of the world as a whole, the consequences for attempting to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange in transmutation are not merely failure and cessation. When too much is attempted out of too little, what occurs is called a Rebound, in which the alchemical forces that are thrown out of balance on either side of the equation fluctuate wildly of their own accord in order to stabilize themselves - taking or giving more than was intended in often unpredictable and catastrophic ways such as accidental mutation, serious injury or death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what happened was that Ed and Al had all the Materials collected for an average adult body, whether or not this matched Trisha's body isn't the problem but what they gave up for the Soul, a couple drops of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is hinted on when Ed is talking to Rose about what makes a human and how Cornello's "miracle" to bring the dead back to life is no act of god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ed:
  Water, 35 liters. Carbon, 20 kilograms. Ammonia, 4 liters. Lime, 1.5 kilograms. Phosphorous, 800 grams. Salt, 250 grams. Saltpeter, 100 grams. Sulfur, 80 grams. Fluorine, 7.5. Iron, 5. Silicon, 3 grams. And trace amounts of fifteen other elements.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Rose:
  What's that?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Ed:
  &lt;strong&gt;It's all the ingredients of the average adult human body, down to the last specks of protein in your eyelashes.&lt;/strong&gt;
  And even though science has given us the entire physical breakdown, there has never been a successful attempt at bringing a human to life.
  &lt;strong&gt;There's still something missing, something scientists haven't been able to find in centuries of research.&lt;/strong&gt;
  So what makes you think that hack-job priest with his parlor tricks is going to be able to?
  And in case you're wondering, all those ingredients can be bought on a child's allowance.
  Humans can be built on the cheap.
  There's no magic to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Rose:
  Well if there's no magic, then you bring someone back to life!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Ed:
  Just a matter of time, Rose.
  Science will find a way.
  Science is the answer to everything.
  If I were you, I'd drop the scriptures and pick up an alchemy book.
  We're the closest thing to gods there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Ed is referring to is the Soul. while scientists in Fullmetal Alchemist can measure all the stuff needed to make a human body the problem arises that there is no equivalent for a soul. even in real life the existence of the Soul is debated because there is no way to confirm it's existence or even measure it to determine what would be of equal value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Ed wasn't sure when they did it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ed:
  Just hold out your finger, okay? 
  What's a soul, really?
  When you take out the myth, it's just the spark that starts life. 
  This is our blood. 
  From her blood. 
  That's a fair trade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so anyway, back to the rebound. It wasn't a fair exchange as a couple drops of blood wouldn't equal a soul so Al's entire body, soul included, was taken along with Ed's leg by the wildly fluctuating equation taking more than it should in it's attempt to stabilize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can even call the end result to be a cause of the rebound, Trisha was given &lt;em&gt;"life"&lt;/em&gt; but her body wasn't properly reformed as her organs outside her body not to mention there is no way to confirm if Trisha's soul has been brought back. in the 2003 Anime we learn that this Trisha did continue to live but as a Homunculus didn't have a soul and was missing parts of her memories while in Brotherhood and the Manga, Ed exhumes Trisha's body which Pinako buried and Ed learns that what it wasn't Trisha as her hair colour and bone structure were different.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="22570" Title="Why didn't Hanekawa want to go home during Mayoi Snail?" Body="&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Mayoi Snail&lt;/em&gt; arc in &lt;em&gt;Bakemonogatari&lt;/em&gt; we eventually learn that Senj&#333;gahara couldn't see Hachikuji while Araragi could, because only those who didn't want to return home would be able to see her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But while Araragi was waiting for Senj&#333;gahara to get back from seeing Oshino, Hanekawa turns up and is able to see Hachikuji. Later in &lt;em&gt;Tsubasa Cat&lt;/em&gt; we learn that the stress which caused Black Hanekawa to appear was from Hanekawa's repressed feeling for Araragi and not from family problems which caused Black Hanekawa's original appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering, was there a particular reason why Hanekawa didn't want to go home or were things getting worse between her and her parents?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="22573">&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the last episode of the "Mayoi Snail" arc, we are told that Araragi is being led astray by Hachikuji after he didn't want to go home, because he was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;feeling awkward because it's Mother's Day, fought with [his] sister, and didn't want to go home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, past 14 minutes into the episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The condition for encountering a lost cow is to have a desire not to go home. But everyone feels that way at some point. After all, everyone has family problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it doesn't have to be a particularly strong lack of desire to go home -- it doesn't have to be something "big" enough to lead to another appearance of Black Hanekawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having thus obtained an explanation for why he saw Hachikuji from Senjougahara, Araragi thinks of Hanekawa, and concludes to himself that Hanekawa &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; able to see Hachikuji because of her family problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And so did [Hanekawa]. Carrying the weight of bad blood and strain within her family . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So it simply looks like while Hanekawa's stress with her parents dissipated somewhat after the first Black Hanekawa possession, the underlying problems were never resolved.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, in the beginning of "Tsubasa Tiger", which is in the second season of the series and which is after &lt;em&gt;Bakemonogatari&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; we learn that Hanekawa (still) doesn't have a room of her own in her house, and sleeps on the floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at the very least, it looks like &lt;em&gt;Araragi&lt;/em&gt; thinks that Hanekawa's ability to see Hachikuji is entirely to be expected, and not a cause for concern about new developments. It's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that Hanekawa is keeping her friend in the dark about things -- if I'm not mistaken, in the "Suruga Monkey" arc, we see her lying to Araragi about where she is. &lt;strong&gt;But &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; something new has come up between her and her parents, it probably isn't anything out of the ordinary, at least in that we never see any more detail go into this in the anime and in that it never turns into a massive crisis on its own.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22574">&lt;p&gt;Just because she wasn't stressed by her family situation doesn't mean she was not bothered by it and didn't want to return home. The situation with her parents was still same, but as Araragi notes, it would take some time before her stress built up enough from that. The stress from her unrequited love was much worse and accumulated much faster. Most probably because she spent all her time outside so her family situation was not on her mind all the time. But she met Araragi all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things started getting better with her family only after Tsubasa Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Japanese expression of confusion. Often used by otaku to indicate confusion/disorientation.&lt;/strong&gt; People who read/watch "Rurouni Kenshin" may pick up the habit of saying "Oro!" because Himura Kenshin says it often in the manga/anime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himura_Kenshin"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; on Himura Kenshin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobuhiro Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark "oro" as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency "huh"&lt;/strong&gt;. Watsuki notes that he was surprised at how much it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch a few of his Oro moments &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGrOxc8cOuA"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  (and see that he usually uses it when he's confused/disoriented).&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of Tokyo ESP, Kagura is waiting for Yomi somewhere.&lt;br&gt;&#10;Is Tokyo ESP a continuation to Ga-Rei?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQe9V.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQe9Vl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kagura and Yomi&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="12841">&lt;p&gt;The comment by josephting got it mostly right. Ga-Rei and Tokyo ESP are both manga by Segawa Hajime (Ga-Rei: Zero also shares script writer Takayama Katsuhiko with the Tokyo ESP anime). Showing Kagura and Yomi (and later two other characters from Ga:Rei Zero) was likely intended as a throwback reference to Ga-Rei. I guess from a practical standpoint, it would serve to alert people who otherwise weren't paying attention to such things that they're by the same author. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ga-Rei and Tokyo ESP are pretty clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the same universe. It should be enough that the mangaka has never indicated anything to the contrary, but there are also in-universe reasons why they can't be. For obvious reasons, if it were, it would necessarily happen before Ga-Rei: Zero. But in the Ga-Rei universe, ordinary people weren't aware of all the supernatural phenomena. In fact, in the opening of the first episode, they order a &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/fxLMovytTmk?t=55s" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;media blackout as per "Section 3B of Form 12"&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, in Tokyo ESP, ESP users are generally known to the public well before the first episode (specifically, in chapter 12). In addition, the events of Tokyo ESP simply don't fit on the Ga-Rei timeline, since we know essentially the full backstory of the characters and there's nothing remotely like what happens in Tokyo ESP, nor do any ESP users show up anywhere in Ga-Rei. Barring some major retconning, we can safely say that these aren't the same universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the manga, the scenes with characters from Ga-Rei don't happen. In fact, very little of what happened in episode 1 is in the manga at all. What did happen is in chapters 22 and 23. Kagura and Yomi haven't appeared at all in the manga as far as I've read (chapter 30). However, the series is no stranger to cameos. We'll certainly be seeing some of (spoilers) &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Thi0.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; and likely quite a few others. With that in mind, Ga-Rei cameos aren't particularly out of place here, but they won't be playing any big role.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="19134" Title="Do seniority relations among the fleet girls have any basis in properties of the actual ships?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I notice, for example, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Akagi&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Akagi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Kaga&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Kaga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both began construction in 1920, and they're portrayed as being more senior than &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Fubuki_(1927)&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Fubuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Mutsuki&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Mutsuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Y%C5%ABdachi_(1936)&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Yuudachi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all of which only began construction later on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this a reasonably consistent pattern among the other fleet girls? Or is it more or less arbitrary which girls are portrayed as being senior to others? (Or is it not arbitrary, but based on something else entirely, like ship class?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20456">&lt;p&gt;A few points that rule out ship age as a deciding factor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nagato&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Mutsu&lt;/em&gt; are the secretary ships of the fleet and hold highest seniority, yet the construction of the four &lt;em&gt;Kongou&lt;/em&gt;-class battleships had all been completed at least five years beforehand. The &lt;em&gt;Kongou&lt;/em&gt;-class were all originally battle cruisers, which is a possible reason for their lower seniority assuming it's based on ship class, as the &lt;em&gt;Nagato&lt;/em&gt;-class were dreadnoughts, and the &lt;em&gt;Nagato&lt;/em&gt; often served as flagship IRL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ashigara&lt;/em&gt; and the other three &lt;em&gt;Myoukou&lt;/em&gt;-class heavy cruisers are depicted as teachers. However, every single &lt;em&gt;Mutsuki&lt;/em&gt;-class destroyer was completed around 4-5 years before them, and they're &lt;em&gt;Ashigara&lt;/em&gt;'s students in the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ooyodo&lt;/em&gt; light cruiser was completed in 1943, well after most other ships in the fleet, but works with &lt;em&gt;Nagato&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mutsu&lt;/em&gt;, which is likely because she was originally intended as a command vessel for submarine operations and briefly served as flagship of the Combined Fleet before being sunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Shimakaze&lt;/em&gt; was also older than the &lt;em&gt;Mutsu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the other references to real-life attributes of the various ships and their histories (e.g. the &lt;em&gt;Sendai&lt;/em&gt; fought all of her battles at night, hence her character's obsession therewith), I would guess fleet seniority is handled based on ship roles in the actual Combined Fleet, which would roughly follow ship class just because of the different capabilities/stats of each. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information of the ships are referenced from Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Preface: This is coming entirely from the anime&#8217;s perspective and yet without the 2013 one, which I've only started watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are introduced to Shinku, Hina-Ichigo, Suigintou, Suiseiseki and Souseiseki in the first season in order of appearance. Bara-Suishou and Kanaria are introduced in the first and third episodes of &lt;em&gt;Tr&#228;umend,&lt;/em&gt; respectively. During episode 1 of &lt;em&gt;Tr&#228;umend&lt;/em&gt;, Shinku explicitly refers to herself as the fifth Rozen Maiden doll, and Bara-Suishou answers to the seventh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 1 of the OVA &lt;em&gt;Ouvert&#252;re&lt;/em&gt;, we learn that Shinku then only knew about three Rozen Maiden dolls at the time of &lt;em&gt;Ouvert&#252;re.&lt;/em&gt; However, for some reason, she knows that there should be seven. Also in that episode, Shinku gets to know Suigintou for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; She finds out, that Suigintou is broken and initially does not even have a &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mystica&lt;/em&gt; thus concluding that she shouldn&#8217;t be a Rozen Maiden. However in the second OVA episode, Suigintou has been restored after defeat and granted a &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mystica,&lt;/em&gt; obviously making her a true Rozen Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 12 of &lt;em&gt;Tr&#228;umend,&lt;/em&gt; we learn that&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Bara-Suishou was not an original &lt;em&gt;Rozen Maiden&lt;/em&gt; but rather an &lt;em&gt;Enju Maiden&lt;/em&gt; being crafted by a different doll maker. It is not clearly revealed as far as I can tell whether she has a &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mystica&lt;/em&gt; but she cannot cope with winning the Alice game and thus the other six girls&#8217; &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mysticas,&lt;/em&gt; possibly because she is not pure enough. In any case, the situation is restored to a pre-Alice-game situation where only those dolls defeated by Rozen Maidens stay defeated: Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki (by Shinku and Suigintou).&lt;br&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#10; I conclude from these facts, that Bara-Suishou is quite a bit younger than the other dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the dolls must somehow know that there are seven of them but not who they are until they met each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did they know that they must be seven?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How and why did they know the how many-th doll they are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; How was it possible that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the six met the seventh &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; Rozen Maiden in the over 100 years that they had been living and fighting all over the world, so that they all assumed Bara-Suishou to be the proper seventh?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Shouldn&#8217;t there have been any clues for the other dolls that Bara-Suishou is &#8216;non-canonical&#8217;? E.g. the scene at the end of &lt;em&gt;Tr&#228;umend&lt;/em&gt; 10 where they meet Enju and call him &lt;em&gt;father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28009">&lt;p&gt;The question "How and how much do the dolls know about the other dolls?" is hard to answer by the anime perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many details are included about the dolls' past in the anime, and the plot offered in both &lt;em&gt;Tr&#228;umend&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ouvert&#252;re&lt;/em&gt; was discontinued, as they were animation original plots, not related to the manga storyline, so what we have seen is all we have to try and deduce answers for that specific scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second manga series advanced the manga story, and gave more information about the Rozen Maiden's past. And it contradicts and negates the information given by &lt;em&gt;Ouvert&#252;re&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is revealed that, at first, the dolls all lived together in what they called "The Miniature Garden", altought it was more of a big deposit than a real garden. They spent time together, playing around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, events happened, and while they expected their creator to be making a seventh doll, neither the seventh nor their creator ever appeared, and as they started to question wether they had ben abandoned and forgotten, LaPlace appeared before them and started the Alice Game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, by the manga plot, the six know maidens all knew about each other, because they lived together as sisters before the game began. But they never knew if a seventh really existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the manga plot also does not have a Bara-Suishou. She exists only for the anime plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the actual seventh doll, the reason none of the maidens met her over the years, is because the seventh doll did not have a real body, so she was not able to properly participate in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but since I still haven't finished reading the manga, this is all I know at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the descriptions in your question matches the details in the first chapter of the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt; (From MangaHelpers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hori may seem like a normal teenage girl, but she's a completely different person after school. In her workaholic parents' absence, &lt;strong&gt;Hori has been like a parent for her little brother since she was young herself&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Between taking care of her brother, feeding them both, and housework&lt;/strong&gt;, she doesn't have much time for a usual teenage social life. One day, she meets someone else who does not present his true self at school: a quiet, glasses-wearing boy called Miyamura. &lt;strong&gt;She'd assumed he was bookish, and possibly an otaku&lt;/strong&gt;, but Hori couldn't have been more wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Outside of school&lt;/strong&gt;, Miyamura is a friendly guy &lt;strong&gt;with many piercings&lt;/strong&gt;, and he's not very good at academics. Now the two of them have someone with whom they can share both halves of their lives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the cover of the first volume, which shows both character in their "school mode". Note how Miyamura (the male character) leaves his hair long and has a nerdy look, while Hori (the female character) looks very stylish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raven Tail was just an exception, and one of the judges (the former council member) told the guest judge (council lacky) to keep a close eye on Raven Tail.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I noticed that in the beginning of the anime Kirito was downloading something on his computer, and then played SAO with the NerveGear after it was finished downloading.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;so my question is how would you get a game for the NerveGear and install it on/in on the NerveGear in the anime?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43708">&lt;p&gt;I have not read the light novels, but based on two very quick scenes in the anime, Sword Art Online, even Alfheim Online, does not get installed into the NerveGear itself. The game is installed or inserted into a secondary device to which the NerveGear is connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the beginning of episode 1, Kirito is getting ready to log into SAO and we can see the title "Sword Art Online" on a console shortly after putting on the NerveGear&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="28136" Title="Were any of Houkago Tea Time's songs described or referred to in the manga?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;K-On!!&lt;/em&gt; anime features a large number of songs performed by Houkago Tea Time. In addition to staples like &quot;Gohan wa Okazu&quot;  and &quot;Fuwa Fuwa Time&quot;, there are a number of other ones that I don't believe ever got playtime in the anime, like &quot;Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss&quot;, to say nothing of the OP/ED themes and their B-sides, plus a ton of character songs (and not just for the main five, but also for Ui, Jun, and Nodoka). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, I haven't read the manga, but it's clearly inconceivable that all these dozens of songs could have been described in any substantial way in a mere four volumes of manga. In fact, I have to wonder if any of these songs were even noted as existing in the manga.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do any of the songs in the anime originate in any way from the manga (even if only by virtue of a shared title or a lyrical excerpt)? If so, which ones?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Ignore &quot;Tsubasa wo Kudasai&quot;, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_wo_Kudasai&quot;&gt;a cover of a very old song&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28137">&lt;p&gt;This is all based on memory as I don't have the manga volumes to hand at the moment, but several of the songs were mentioned by title in the manga, and a few of them had lyrics shown that were used in the anime versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Fuwa Fuwa Time" was in the manga, and we even see its lyrics in one scene when Mio hands her draft of the song to the others for feedback. If I remember correctly, "Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss" and "Fudepen Ballpen" are mentioned on the set list before one of the concerts. I believe that "Curry Nochi Rice" was also mentioned late in the manga, and I'm fairly sure the storyline where Yui first writes "Gohan wa Okazu", then writes "U&amp;amp;I" for Ui after Ui falls ill happened in the manga the same way it happened in the anime. I believe we did also see the lyrics for "U&amp;amp;I" when Ui finds Yui asleep at her desk after working on the song all night and looks over what Yui wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening and ending themes were never mentioned or hinted at in the manga, and several of the other songs--e.g. "Pure Pure Heart", "Tenshi ni Nareta yo!"--were associated with anime-only plots. But a surprising number of the songs in the anime were actually mentioned by title in the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I bought the digital editions and hunted down photographic evidence of my earlier claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Volume 1, we see Ritsu and Sawako react with horror as they read Mio's draft of "Fuwa Fuwa Time".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUlRr.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUlRr.jpg" alt="fuwa fuwa time"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background of the third and fourth panels on the left, we can see the first few stanzas of the song translated into English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Volume 2, Mio hands Ritsu a set list with four songs on it: "Fuwa Fuwa Time", "Curry Nochi Rice", "Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss", and "Fudepen Ballpen":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4NMHl.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4NMHl.png" alt="set list vol 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in Volume 4, we see Yui write "Gohan wa Okazu":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xhqe1l.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xhqe1l.png" alt="gohan wa okazu"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then later "U&amp;amp;I":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGTApl.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGTApl.jpg" alt="u&amp;amp;i"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Volume 4, we also get a few lines from a song that Mio was working on, which provokes the usual revulsion in Ritsu and Azusa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjf31l.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjf31l.png" alt="unknown song"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the chapter, Ritsu declares that they'll develop a song around these lyrics in addition to "U&amp;amp;I" to spare Mio's feelings. However, I don't think there was any song in the anime based around these lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28138">&lt;p&gt;Of all the songs released, &lt;em&gt;Fuwa Fuwa Time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gohan was Okazu&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;U&amp;amp;I&lt;/em&gt; are the only pieces that appeared in the manga.  This can be verified by noticing that they are only songs whose lyrics are officially attributed to the original author.   You can look at the Note 28 of &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E3%81%91%E3%81%84%E3%81%8A%E3%82%93!&amp;amp;oldid=57176494#.E6.8C.BF.E5.85.A5.E6.AD.8C" rel="nofollow"&gt;the relevant article in the Japanese Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to see this.  Note that even for these songs, only some part of the songs appeared in the books; they were significantly augmented by a professional lyricist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is noted by another answer, there were other songs whose titles appeared in the books.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="8846" Title="Is a talisman still usable if the Tree of Genesis is destroyed?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Zetsuen no Tempest we encounter Hakaze bestowing talismans that make you a substitute mage/magician, although this has some limits due to the fact that unlike a real mage, it eventually becomes unusable, and requires a blessing of some type from Hakaze Kusaribe before it can be used.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because it stores the power of the Tree of Genesis in it, would it still be usuable even after the Tree of Genesis is destroyed? I was thinking that the talismans are almost like batteries and could possibly be used even after the Tree of Genesis is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8866">&lt;p&gt;No, the talismans will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's stated at the end of the story that all magic in the world disappeared along with the Trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why this happens, it's because of how magic works (described in Chapter 3 of the manga, pages 17-18). When a mage uses magic, their powers are being borrowed directly from a Tree. None of the mages ever have their own magical power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, talismans are conduits, not batteries. Any magical power that's being stored would still be owned by the Tree of Genesis until it's actually used, with the talisman acting as a conduit between the Tree of Genesis and the person whose skin is touching the talisman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a relatable example: It'd be like if you &lt;em&gt;(the mage)&lt;/em&gt; went out and got a refillable Visa card &lt;em&gt;(the talisman)&lt;/em&gt; and then put some money &lt;em&gt;(magical power)&lt;/em&gt; on it in case of an emergency. The Visa card is "storing" your money, and anyone can use it as long as you're there to sign for it &lt;em&gt;(the mage's voice activation)&lt;/em&gt;. However, if Visa &lt;em&gt;(the Tree of Genesis)&lt;/em&gt; suddenly ceases to exist one day, your Visa card is completely worthless, and all the money it was storing will be gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was alluded to near the beginning of the manga, when Hakaze had to ask the Tree of Genesis for power in order to use the talisman to find Aika's killer (chapter 2, page 21 in the manga).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later (chapter 3, page 18), Hakaze explains that talismans still require voice activation, because the Tree of Genesis won't supply its magical power unless the mage asks for it verbally. It's explained that the main characters are able to use the worn talismans without Hakaze's voice because Hakaze verbally asked the Tree of Genesis for that magical power ahead of time, and then asked for the given power to be activated when the wearer of the talisman invokes it mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unfortunately for them, the characters of Zetsuen no Tempest won't have the ability to use magic anymore, with or without talismans.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to find out how far Ash traveled across the Kanto region in the anime. But I haven't been able to find a good way to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't mind if reference to the game is required to get to a proper answer.&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRwL2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRwL2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="52988">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interesting question and strangely enough, I've been asked a variation of this question several years ago, and this is how I tried to estimate the size of the Pokemon World in the games at least. The biggest challenge would be to scale something in the Pokemon Universe to something in real life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An easy and trivial approach would be is to first, slice the picture into squares. Then, the obvious thing to do would be to look at the number of squares covered by a particular character or object that you have an accurate distance for, and then, it is simply a matter of converting those figures into the number of squares you have remaining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the question is to find that particular object or character. One interesting way of doing it, would be to use a Legendary Pokemon or some of the Pokemon that appear on the map like Poliwrath in Celadon City or Slowbro in Cerulean city. Since these pokemon have a fixed height, we could simply look at the number of squares they take up. Then we basically see the number of Slowbro or Polywrath we can Place on a map. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example would be something like, a Slowbro takes up 2*2 squares = 4 squares. Now suppose we can split Cerulean city into a 1000 squares, we can technically fit 250 Slowbros on the map.  Then we can simply multiply the distance with the final value you have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the value would obviously be incredibly inaccurate. However, it is a decent enough strategy to accomplish the task at hand. However, your question with regard to the anime, would be impossible the answer because, in the anime, the map is obviously significantly more extended and has lots of new places which isn't present on the game maps. To top it off, the characters also get lost and take several detours to reach a particular destination and, since they do most of their traveling on foot, a huge chunk of their travels is often cut out or skipped until they reason a particular decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&lt;/em&gt;, Orb is shown to be hiding the Gundam development program. They are also later shown to be developing the mass production model's OS and training the first pilots for the frame.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why is a neutral nation producing the Federation's main weapon and only trump card in the war?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23294">&lt;p&gt;I would think it would be similar to any "neutral nation". In the sense that neutrality is only an illusion. A country like Switzerland was neutral because of their impossible terrain and their trained militia, they held a distinct advantage that made their conquest, 1)nearly impossible 2) requiring immense sacrifice and pain on the part of the aggressor and thus 3) not worth the effort. The simple honest answer is so they can continue to remain neutral. Gundams are super-weapons, the nuclear bombs of their day. If Orb were to not build them and remain "neutral" there would come a point where if an when one of the other two superpower's fell to the other, that they would be helpless against the winner - assuming the world wasn't destroyed by the conflict which I will address in a second. Mutually Assured Destruction, if you attack me I will retaliate to the full extent of my ability, causing you immense damage and equal pain to my own suffering. If I perish I shall mortally wound you with my last breath. Further the looming possibility total annihilation of both superpowers by each other hand's and the rest of the world along with it was a threat to everyone including Orb. It would be a threat that would be diminished by a further third party, with equivalent weapons, who could enter on either side giving a distinct advantage and tipping the balance of power. Thus Orb would act as an anchor, making sure that neither side went off the deep end. In the end it's all about self preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I notice that a fair number of people (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2id9xl/spoilers_grisaia_no_kajitsu_episode_1_discussion/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on reddit&lt;/a&gt;) refer to Kazami Yuuji (protagonist of Grisaia) as &quot;Juicy Yuuji&quot;. Why? What's so juicy about him?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also: I haven't noticed anybody in the anime (up through episode 4) refer to Yuuji as &quot;juicy&quot; or anything of that sort. Is the &quot;Juicy Yuuji&quot; nickname (or some Japanese equivalent thereof) used in canon (e.g. the visual novel) at some point, or is it purely a fan invention?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14794">&lt;p&gt;In the Visual Novel (not sure about the anime), there is a scene in which Michiru and Makina start a conversation with Yuuji. Specifically, Michiru complains to Yuuji that he is hard to talk to because he gives off a certain aura. She then suggests that they give him a nickname to make him easier to talk to, similar to how Makina calls Michiru "Chiruchiru". Yuuji says that they're free to call him whatever name they like, though he doesn't see any need for a nickname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michiru then makes her first proposal for a nickname &#12300;&#12470;&#12539;&#36817;&#23492;&#12426;&#38627;&#12356;&#20154;&#12301;,&#12288;which literally means "The person who is difficult to approach", or as the fan-translation says, "Mr. Standoffish man". Neither Makina nor Yuuji is very happy with this name, because it's not exactly easy to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They go back to brainstorming, and Makina comes up with the second suggestion: "Juicy-Yuuji". Michiru isn't happy with this; she agrees that it sounds nice, but doesn't see what part of Yuuji is "Juicy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, Yumiko comes by asking them to be quiet. She ends up getting roped into the conversation, and Michiru asks her to come up with more names. She first agrees with "Juicy Yuuji", but then offers as an alternative "Yujiyuji". After Michiru laughs at this, she exits the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the VN, Michiru then forces the decision on Yuuji as to which nickname he wants. You have the choice of any of those three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMAY6l.jpg" alt="Nickname choice"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, for the rest of the scene you're referred to by that name. However, Yuuji decides to get back at Michiru by giving her an equally terrible nickname. Eventually he ends up selecting "Mitcher", which Michiru finds to be very unpleasant. He continues on a rampage, giving Sachi, Amane, and Makina the nicknames "Satcher", "Atcher", and "Matcher", until Michiru apologizes and pledges not to use the nickname you chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice never has any impact on future events in the VN, and none of the main events from that scene come up again in the future as far as I can remember, but I guess this nickname became popular in the fan community.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="3854" Title="How does binding a soul to an armor suit allow the suit to move?" Body="&lt;p&gt;We know a couple of characters whose souls are bound to armor suits, e.g. Alphonse or Barry the Chopper. It was explicitly shown that the armor suits have nothing inside - which means they are just pieces of metal with an rune that binds the soul to the armor. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjSn7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So how are they able to move at all, not to mention that they have significant physical strength and agility?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3864">&lt;p&gt;I think it's the soul that enables the suit to move, and thus the armor gets the soul's owner's ability and techniques.  Due to the binding process they no longer feel fatigue or pain, and they also no longer feel the need to sleep or rest, which explains why Alphonse never gets tired or feels physical pain when fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="3865">&lt;p&gt;In each case of a bonded soul, the blood is directly placed against the armor, allowing the iron in the hemoglobin to physically interact with the metal (and presumably any other material it would be bonded with)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_Rune" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This means, basically, that the alchemic procedure allows the soul to interact with the metal as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a blood seal is made, it is connected to a being, and must remain with only that being, as well as it must be connected. That means that if Al loses his arm, he cannot move it; however, if he picks up an iron pipe, he cannot move that at free will either, as it was not bonded to him initially. (Even at one point, he transmutes part of his body and can no longer manipulate it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQcwv.png" alt="Barry sees Alphonse&amp;#39;s empty armor"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Note: Alphonse has no eyes lit up in his helmet because the helmet is separated.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; universe, souls are that which contain a being's personality, thoughts, and memories, which is seen later in the series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; For example: Kimblee's soul is able to connect with Pride from within; Hohenheim's many souls are spread around the land and are able to think and act with their energy; and Hohenheim was able to speak and interact with the emotions and arguments of every soul within him from the memories that soul kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we can connect the dots: Alphonse's soul is connected to the armor through the blood seal, and is able to act with his full set of memories; thus, Alphonse can use his memories and thoughts to move the armor at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical strength and agility comes from their ability to not be restrained by inner forces. (Imagine how much faster you could run if your body worked the same, but without bones and muscles weighing you down!) However, all the fighting skill and ability comes from things that soul has learned (both before getting that body, and after).&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently watched the &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; anime and I found there are two movies. Is there an order I should watch them in?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26155">&lt;p&gt;Yes there is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First would be: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note_%28film%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;Death Note (film)&lt;/a&gt; which was latter the same year (2006) followed up by a second movie: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note_2:_The_Last_Name" rel="nofollow"&gt;Death Note 2: The Last Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second movie continues on where the first one left off. Which is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; When Misa receives a second Death Note from Rem, another Shinigami. As Light joins the task force after Shiori's funeral, Misa becomes the second Kira and forces a TV station into broadcasting her tapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26156">&lt;p&gt;There are actually 3 movies, and all 3 were released in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6383"&gt;Death Note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first movie in which Light finds the Death Note. However, it ends before Light and Misa meet, and deviates slightly from the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6911"&gt;Death Note: The Last Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when Misa and Light end up meeting and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; L finds out Light is Kira by writing his own name in the Death Note, making him immune to Rem killing him. Thus, his death scene in front of Light was an act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8161"&gt;L: Change The World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a spin-off set just before the end of the second movie...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; where we see L die in the last scene. The movie takes place during the time L had left before his life was to end because of him writing his name in the Death Note. This movie is also where we first see the live adaptation of Near when L takes a boy he meets to Wammy's House and names him Near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the Anime Movies &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Note_Relight_1%3A_Visions_of_a_God"&gt;Death Note Relight: Visions of a God&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Note_Relight_2:_L%27s_Successors"&gt;Death Note Relight 2: L's Successors&lt;/a&gt;, these are in chronological order as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; the second movie is when Near and Mello appear; they only appear when L dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while they are feature-length, these are more of an abridged version of the anime, much like the first 2 &lt;em&gt;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&lt;/em&gt; movies (though the difference is that while the 2 Madoka movies cover 12 x ~25 minute episodes, the 2 Death Note anime movies covers 37 x ~25 minute episodes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unlike the live-action movies, the anime movies can be considered a continuation from the anime as Ryuk is actually telling another Shinigami about his experience in the Human World when he was with Light,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; and there is a fan theory that says that the Shinigami is Light. However, the rules of the Death Note invalidate this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I've seen many anime but faced with a word I could not find the meaning of -  anime &quot;franchises&quot; such as &lt;em&gt;Fate/Stay Night&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What does &quot;franchises&quot; mean in this context?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43487">&lt;p&gt;Franchise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;an authorization granted by a government or company to an individual or group enabling them to carry out specified commercial activities, e.g., providing a broadcasting service or acting as an agent for a company's products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means in the context of anime is that someone has an original idea, usually a manga, and has given the right to make anime, merchandise, extend the idea/story as they see fit, etc. to a second person/entity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://animeyume.com/blog/2012/05/30/anime-franchises/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; talks extensively about what a franchise means to an anime fan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They&#8217;re an anime but also a manga, light novel, video game, trading card game, collection of toys, or any number of mediums. I wonder how many anime fans get into all the franchise branches of a particular series, or whether they&#8217;re content to just watch the anime and nothing more&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43488">&lt;p&gt;Definition #11 of &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/franchise#Noun" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"franchise" at en.wiktionary&lt;/a&gt; is what you want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The loose collection of fictional works pertaining to a particular universe, including literary, film or television series from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would dispute the notion that this sense of "franchise" necessarily involves "an authorization granted by a government or company". This is certainly true of franchises in the legal sense (the McDonald's sense), but in common parlance today, we would refer to &lt;em&gt;Fate&lt;/em&gt; as a franchise even if all of its component works were produced by the same corporate entity (Type-Moon, say). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that a defining feature of a "franchise" in this sense is the existence of a wide variety of media constituting the franchise. For example, it would be odd to describe a standalone novel as a franchise, but if there was also an associated manga or anime or something, it would be more "franchise-esque".&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43489">&lt;p&gt;The more general term for this is "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;media franchise&lt;/a&gt;" which is also famously known as "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_mix" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;media mix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;media franchise&lt;/strong&gt; is a collection of related media in which several derivative works have been produced from an original creative work, such as a film, a work of literature, a television program or a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Japanese culture and entertainment, &lt;strong&gt;media mix&lt;/strong&gt; (wasei-eigo: &#12513;&#12487;&#12451;&#12450;&#12511;&#12483;&#12463;&#12473;, mediamikkusu) is a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations: different broadcast media, gaming technologies, cell phones, toys, amusement parks, and other methods. The term gained its circulation in late 1980s, however the origins of the strategy can be traced back to 1960s with the proliferation of anime with its interconnection of media and commodity goods. It is the Japanese equivalent of a media franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude and reiterate, it is when an original work (e.g. anime) has derivative works on other media (e.g. manga, game). Recent media includes manga, anime, light novel, game, music CD, TV drama, movie, web radio, figures, talent (&lt;em&gt;Love Live!&lt;/em&gt;), trading card (&lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh!&lt;/em&gt;), plastic model (&lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt;) and others.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand that the Akki is immune to the death feedback when considering humans, but the Akki couldn't have possibly done that to the Giant Hornets, the Akki could have at most disarmed the soldiers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That being said, how did the Giant Hornets die? Or is this something that is lost in translation? (I was watching the Japanese version with English subtitles).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5229">&lt;p&gt;I don't think it was ever stated how exactly they were wiped out, but we do know that it wasn't a WMD (no damage to the surrounding land), it wasn't the fiend that killed them (death feedback), and that the fiend stopped their arrows and disarmed them. It's also possible the fiend prevented the Giant Hornet soldiers from attacking any of the Robber Fly and that's why none of them were killed. Being unable to fight back, all the Robber Fly soldiers had to do was slaughter them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That could also be the reason Kiroumaru was the sole survivor of the battle, in order to bring suspicion onto him from the humans. The Robber Fly could have purposely let him live.&lt;/p&gt;

And that feeding QB with them is a way to stop entropy?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Homura says to Sayaka and Madoka that one day they will be enemies, is she referring to the fact that without suffering sooner or later the universe will run out of energy and Madoka and Sayaka will have to stop her?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5927">&lt;p&gt;After watching Rebellion on the weekend i've edited my answer account for the new knowledge i have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have a doubt about the fact that although Madoka wish in the second movie, which prevented the birth of any witch, both in the past and in the future. Why then Homura becomes a Witch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magical girls still turn into Witches even with the Law of Cycles however Madoka would appear before the Soul Gem became a Grief Seed. the Incubators captured Homura and put her tainted Soul Gem in an isolation field which would prevent it from being affected by the law of Cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Isolation Field was one way allowing people to enter but not escape so when Madoka along with Sayaka and Bebe came for Homura they became trapped as well and Madoka's memories were altered as well, it wasn't until after the field was destroyed could Madoka escape and treat Homura's Soul Gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the ending we see Homura feeding QB with her soul gem. Does this mean that all the curses of the universe are now contained in Homura's soul gem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of Madoka's Wish prevents the creation of Witches however the curses on Earth still existed and became Wraiths, also what Homura is feeding Quebe is Cubes left behind by Wraiths when they die, just like what Grief Seeds were, however Soul Gems still become darkened with despair and in time will turn a Magical Girl into a Witch however Madoka's Wish allows the Soul Gem to be purified and allow the Magical Girl to die without becoming a Witch, Mami notes this by saying how no one knows why Soul Gems shatter like they do, ofcause Homura knows as she's the only one to know Madoka and her Wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;feeding QB with them is a way to stop entropy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cubes seems to have the same effect but somewhat limited as Quebe does note that the current system with the Wraiths doesn't prevent entropy but slows it down considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Homura says to Sayaka and Madoka that one day they will be enemies, is she referring to the fact that without suffering sooner or later the universe will run out of energy and Madoka and Sayaka will have to stop her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homura only actually says this to Madoka as Homura asked Madoka if she valued order and Madoka replied that it was wrong to break the rules. Homura broke the Law of Cycles making herself exempt from it by becoming something else. there's also the matter about Madoka who doesn't remember that she's a Goddess which could mean that the Law of Cycles will not be upheld. Homura &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; that if Madoka regains her memories they may end up becoming enemies. Also Homura didn't give back Madoka's ribbon because they could one day be enemies, Homura says that it looked better on Madoka and to Homura the ribbon was a reminder Madoka existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sayaka, after she was taken by the Law of Cycles in the previous universe she was made into Madoka's Secretary and existed the same as Madoka however having control over her witch form. Sayaka knows of the implications Homura's new Law of Cycles and thinks it's going to spell tragedy for the rest of the universe however when asked if Homura was out to destroy it all Homura replied "maybe, once all the Wraiths' have been destroyed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the universe running out of energy, that was going to happen in the previous universe as well because before the countermeasure for entropy was to harvest the energy from when Magical Girls became Witches which thanks to the Law of Cycles could not be done anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should be noted however that "counteracting entropy" was the Incubators goal, apart from Homura the other Magical Girls were mostly unaware of this in the original universe as Madoka was told this when she was in her room after Sayaka was killed. only Madoka and Homura would remember this system and the Incubators would have deduced the effects from talking with Homura.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6070">&lt;p&gt;Ok, let me try to answer this the best I can. I've watched the movie twice: in a theatre in Paris and the subbed camrip that's been going around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;although Madoka wish in the second movie, which prevented the birth of any witch, both in the past and in the future. Why then Homura becomes a Witch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoka's wish wasn't &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; that. She wished to erase all the witches, past, present and future &lt;strong&gt;with her own hands&lt;/strong&gt;. The bolded part being the interesting one. Not only did it mean the wish couldn't have any unfortunate fulfilling that wasn't what she wanted, it meant she would have to do the work herself. Which is also the only reason it invokes a paradox that forces her existence into a concept. Either way, the point is, Madoka takes the despair out of the Soul Gems of Magical Girls as they are about to become witches. The natural tainting process of the Soul Gem still exists and the girls would still become witches if she wasn't there to take their souls to wherever and let them have a dignified death.
Only in Homura's case this time, she wasn't there. To expand upon it, what the Incubators do is use their super advanced alien science to freeze Homura's Soul Gem at a borderline state. She's about to become a witch, but she's still a magical girl. Let's say for the sake of an analogy that her Soul Gem was 99.99% tainted. That's where they froze her at. Because that's the point at which Madoka would come in and save her from becoming a witch as she did to everyone throughout the series and they wanted to capture Madoka. So, frozen at this state, the Soul Gem couldn't break and impose a witch barrier over some part of this world (which is still a separate dimension of its own), so it created a barrier of sorts inside itself. Basically, the first part of the movie was spent inside Homura's Soul Gem. Note that at this point, the world they're in may be akin to a witch barrier, but Homura &lt;strong&gt;isn't&lt;/strong&gt; a witch, as the barrier was created by what is still her Soul Gem.
After the whole ordeal that culminates with her realizing she's the one who created the barrier, Homura is confronted by Kyubey, who tells her about what exactly had happened with her and what their plans for Madoka were. There, she decides to become a witch inside the barrier so she can be killed by Mami and Kyouko there and ensuring Madoka will never come for her. Note that this Homura inside the Soul Gem is basically her soul, so being killed inside it is the same as destroying her Soul Gem. Now she purposely brings upon her more despair and suffering by accepting she won't be able to meet Madoka again and successfully becomes a witch &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; the Soul Gem. This is a separate world of its own, one that Madoka can't see nor reach (which is still kinda of a moot point anyway since Madoka is trapped inside it without any memories of who she even is), which is why it was possible for that to happen. The Homura in the outside world, her physical body, is not yet a witch, since any developments in the inside won't affect the outside thanks to Kyubey's filter.
TL;DR - Homura doesn't become a witch in the outside world, she becomes one inside her own Soul Gem, which is a separate dimension from the one Madoka can see and interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I get an idea, but I'm not pretty sure about it. In the ending we see Homura feeding QB with her soul gem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do? I'm pretty sure that's not what happens so... By ending, are you referring to the post-ending credits? Since that's the only thing I think could have been mistaken by that. But we never see that. All we see is Kyubey appearing, Homura bringing up her Soul Gem, &lt;em&gt;perspective change&lt;/em&gt;, her legs doing some sort of dance, &lt;em&gt;perspective change&lt;/em&gt;, her dancing with a beaten-up Kyubey in the background. If what you're saying does happen at any point, please specify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Homura says to Sayaka and Madoka that one day they will be enemies, is she referring to the fact that without suffering sooner or later the universe will run out of energy and Madoka and Sayaka will have to stop her?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That point is pretty much up in the air, specially her words toward Sayaka. What she says to Madoka is easier to interpret, though. She asks her about her ideals, if she thinks the world is more important than the happiness of one people. Basically "selflessness vs selfishness". And Madoka answers with the former. What this conversation shows is that Homura is fully aware her actions were selfish ones, but won't back down on them since it's what she's always wished for. Madoka's answer, though, goes against the very thing she won't back down from, which means their ideals at the moment are complete opposites, so if Madoka ever understands the situation and comes to want to realize her ideal, it'd only be natural they would become enemies. Which will eventually happen, since it's very doubtful Homura will be able to keep the world as is without either Madoka or Sayaka getting at least part of their memories back. Heck, things were already turning out that way with Madoka and would have if Homura didn't hug her into submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before proceeding, please have in mind that while everything before this paragraph are things I'm nearly certain of having interpreted correctly, this isn't but a theory of mine:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the Sayaka conversation, that's one of the issues I have with this movie, in that Sayaka's question regarding destroying the world came out of absolute nowhere and Homura's answer made no sense at all, considering she says "Once all wraiths are defeated". And since we know from the series the wraiths are the new embodiment of grief and despair in a witch-less world, and that hope and despair can never triumph over one another since the Madoka world is a zero sum game, that makes absolutely no sense at all. So I've thought a lot about that until now and I think a possible (even if not obvious as the one for the Madoka conversation) interpretation is that Homura implying the wraiths will eventually be eliminated means she is, herself, trying to become the embodiment of despair. That way, she'd become a true counterpart to Madoka, who's the embodiment of hope, and the balance would be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22129">&lt;p&gt;I agree with rezark except for the end Houmura became a demon thru Madoka's power as a god therefore when Houmura took Madoka's power she then gained the power to rewrite the world as she seen fit which then refers back to the conversation with Sayaka. When Sayaka asked her question and Houmura responded with "when all wraiths are defeated" she gained the power to throw them back into the world and use them as a source occupation for all the magical girls such as Sayaka Mami BeBe and so on in the time of occupation giving Houmura the time to know there attacks and then keep the world at a stasis with just her and Madoka&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;unknown&lt;/strong&gt; if the Senju clan still exists as an independent clan since it neither became one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure nor is there are any &lt;strong&gt;known&lt;/strong&gt; people with the last name "Senju" &#8212; with the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade, being the only possible exception. Their legacy however, lives on strongly in the hearts of the people of Konoha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.leafninja.com/clans.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Clan Guide&lt;/a&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senju (Thousand Arms) of the Forest were one of the founding clans of Konoha. Under Senju Hashirama, they allied with other clans including the Uchiha, to found the Fire Country's ninja village. It is &lt;strong&gt;unknown&lt;/strong&gt; if Senju retains a clan structure in the current Konoha. Tsunade is the only known living descendant of founding clan of Konoha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the Senju and Uchiha, the Uzumaki clan also has roots leading to the Sage Of Six Paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Uzumaki" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Uzumaki clan&lt;/a&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Descendents from Asura &#332;tsutsuki, being originated from the Senju clan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the &lt;strong&gt;Uzumaki&lt;/strong&gt; clan is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; one of the surviving descendents of the Sage of Six Paths, along with the Uchiha clan.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="7765" Title="Does the world on the other side of the gate exist for alchemy to exist?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In one of the episodes of &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; (the original 2003 anime), Hohenheim of Light is sent to a parallel universe of some sort smaller than the world he once knew by Dante, using a baby as she did some research on The Gate. He says something along the lines off:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Even when we fix a radio with alchemy . . . it takes a life or energy from this world to do it&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know it's not exactly what he told his son Ed (although I do not remember why), but why does this other world exist? Does it just exist to serve the purpose of alchemy?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26839">&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is hard to give, as the anime you are referring to did not follow the source material. However, I believe based on the fact that it was a "parallel" world that one cannot exist without the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one transmutated in the alchemy world, then no one would die in the other world, if no one died in that world then the people would eventually starve and suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just speculation though.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42112">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even when we fix a radio with alchemy . . . it takes a life or energy from this world to do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation, as it is given to the viewer, isn't so much that this world exists for the purpose of alchemy. Rather, the other world is being "tapped into". Alchemists think they are following the principle of Equivalent Exchange; but there is a hidden cost that they are not aware of. This hidden cost is "stolen" from the other world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine running a cable from your neighbour's house to your house, so you can steal their electricity. Every time you use an electrical device, you steal some of your neighbour's electricity. That's basically what it is for alchemy too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You put two slices of bread in your toaster. Two pieces of toast come out. That's equivalent exchange, right? To you, living in your house, it may &lt;strong&gt;seem&lt;/strong&gt; that way. But you're simply not aware of the additional cost (the electricity bill) because you're not the one paying for it (your neighbor is paying the cost)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that I &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; my neighbour to come live next to me so that I could steal his electricity (which is what your question boils down to). Alchemy was simply constructed in a way that it takes the additional cost from another (pre-existing) world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I'm aware, &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; the other world exists is never discussed, because then you must also ask yourself &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; the original (alchemist) world exists, and ponder what existence truly means.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="48455">&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, it's because the series is based heavily on &lt;em&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt; by real-world Dante who the show comments on through its antagonist. In &lt;em&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;, there is a pathway which goes through the Earth and comes out the other end (Inferno and Purgatorio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason the show focuses on this is that in 2003, the main theme is about the dangers of blind belief. In real life, Dante's works pretty much make up the foundation of modern-day Christianity as the church used his depictions of hell for the control of people. The same way &lt;em&gt;FMA&lt;/em&gt; Dante manipulates the people of Liore through religion. &lt;/p&gt;

You can obviously hear her say on the episode of capturing the eight-tails"He took in too much chakra". We know that chakra may influence living beings, so it is possible that Karin's chakra may affect Sasuke's child. Or because Karin helped deliver Sakura and Sasuke's baby, so she might've just kept it. (We know how obsessed Karin can be with something.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="21917" Title="What do we know about Ichigo's father?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime, Ichigo's father, Isshin, is shown to have captain level powers, but I think that it was never mentioned that he was a substitute shinigami. So where does he get his powers?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, why did he hide his powers (or why couldn't he use his powers) for 20 years?  And why did he hide the fact that he was a shinigami from his son?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21918">&lt;p&gt;The below answer contains spoilers (because the anime stops before this was explained).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a little back story before explaining:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after Ichigo is done with the Fullbringers, there is the Final Arc with the Quincies. Ichigo's Zanpaktou in Bankai is broken and he has to fix it with the help of the Zero Division. The man that creates the Zanpaktou tells him that he needs to find his true Zanpaktou, but Ichigo can't because he needs to learn something about his past that is blocking him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how he learns about his father. In 10 chapters, his father finally talks so Ichigo could learn about his past, why he didn't tell him about his Shinigami powers and how his mother died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isshin was the former head of a branch of the Shiba Clan, as the Shiba that Rukia knew (&lt;a href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Kaien_Shiba" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kaien Shiba&lt;/a&gt;), and Captain of the 10th Division. He was in the Shinigami world until Aizen, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname T&#333;sen were doing these experiments with Hollows and Shinigamis in the human world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a while he decided to go to see what is going on in the human world (because people died), and he found a White (an experimental Hollow) and he couldn't defeat it. So Ichigo's mother came and she is revealed to be a Quincy and tried to defeat it. She did it, but she was injured by it, which infected her and she was becoming a Hollow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Kisuke found Ichigo's mother and father and told Isshin that if he wants her
to live he has to sacrifice his power to protect her in a device (as he did with the Vizards, but not 100% the same). He accepted and lost his powers and became a human. So when she died, he got his power back because it stopped protecting her.&lt;/p&gt;

Is this the case? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;P.S.: I know that there are several anime &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; a manga. I also know that there are manga created from games. That's not what I'm asking.

There are indeed some anime that do not have a manga corresponding, and other such things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;, there are also anime series which inspired one or more manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list are some of the (arbitrarily selected as recognizable) names from a more complete list featured on the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeFirst"&gt;TVTropes article "Anime First"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%27s_Rain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wolf's Rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="2354">&lt;p&gt;Yes it is possible. And it is actually quite common. A couple of recent examples would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To"&gt;Sora no Woto (Sound of the Sky)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in both examples here, there is some overlap between the release dates of the Anime and the Manga. But the key point is that the Anime was started first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times an Anime would be done as an original work. Then if the Anime turns out to be extremely popular, then the producers will go ahead and do a Manga as well. (To milk the cash cow.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="2409">&lt;p&gt;Two more examples of series where the anime came before the manga that I am familiar with are &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/180/Vandread"&gt;Vandread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/561/Sakura_Taisen"&gt;Sakura Taisen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;Sakura Wars&lt;/em&gt;); though to be fair, that latter series was a video game franchise first, before being adapted to anime, and then adapted to manga.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4169">&lt;p&gt;It seems that I may be of little help to you, but there is a manga currently ongoing 
and the anime is ahead of both the spin off and the ongoing series. The manga/anime is called 
&lt;em&gt;Mushibugyo&lt;/em&gt;, and the second series is &lt;em&gt;Joujuu Senjin!! Mushibugyo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22132">&lt;p&gt;There is no particular rule that anime ought to be adaptions of existing manga. Many anime are original, written by the director and screenwriters. Some of the most popular of these &lt;strong&gt;receive manga adaptions after&lt;/strong&gt; the anime has started airing. Some of these receive &lt;strong&gt;both a shounen manga and a shoujo manga&lt;/strong&gt;, which are illustrated by differing mangaka and either run in different magazines concurrently or run at different times. Some examples of these titles which have both a shounen adaption and a shoujo adaption are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shin Kidousenki Gundam W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenkuu no Escaflowne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mahoutsukai Tai!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anime that later get adapted into manga is &lt;strong&gt;not uncommon in shoujo&lt;/strong&gt;, as shoujo manga magazines an not financially-viable and make less money than shounen magazines, so they are keen to cash in on a title that already has a fanbase (thereby collecting those prior fans who will then begin to buy their magazine and/or graphic novels who otherwise would not have). Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fillers&lt;/strong&gt; == &lt;strong&gt;Not canon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canon&lt;/strong&gt; == Original material from the original author.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are episodes in Naruto for example, (like Naruto episode 101) which are &lt;strong&gt;canon but were not in the manga&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question of whether content being filler or not has nothing to do with it being in one medium or another (although there's usually a correlation). It's about &lt;strong&gt;who made it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14138">&lt;p&gt;I take "filler episodes" to be episodes that are side-stories that actively avoid making any significant changes to the overall story, in order to extend the length of the series.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are anime series which opted to instead finish the overall story their own way, rather  than use what I would call filler episodes to wait for the manga series to get ahead.  Though this is not the canon the original author made up, I would not consider these filler episodes, but rather an alternate canon.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two series I know of that have done this are Full Metal Alchemist (not Brotherhood), and Full Moon wo Sagashite.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me a silly definition to call anything non-canon according to the original manga author "filler", since most people talk about filler episodes in the context of those episodes that may be skipped, or are less interesting because they are obviously avoiding advancing the overall plot.  Plus, the original definition of the word seems to imply to me that the fandom definition has this meaning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might even consider an episode that is canon even in the original manga to be filler, if it seems that it's being used to extend the length of the series without really accomplishing anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the last scene of episode 4 of Yuru Yuri San Hai (i.e., the third season&#10;of Yuru Yuri anime), Sakurako played with her friends a lottery game for finding out &quot;lucky colors&quot;. She did so by drawing a diagram on the ground and following the lines.&#10;I have never seen this particular kind&#10;of game before, and am wondering if this is some traditional children's game or Sakurako just invented it on the spot. Can anyone provide some clues? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/JMcmm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/JMcmm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31884">&lt;p&gt;This is a method of randomly assigning things called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Leg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"ghost leg"&lt;/a&gt; (in Japanese, called "Amidakuji", which means "Amida lottery"). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the way it works is that each player picks one of the lines at the top. Then, you follow the line downwards. Every time you intersect a horizontal segment, you follow it. Here is an example of one possible outcome for a player of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RWdQ.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RWdQ.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the loop-de-loop and the non-strictly-horizontal cross-segments (like the ones that go left-down-right and right-down-left from the rightmost line) are not used in conventional ghost leg. This is just the show being silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is well-known in Japan (and maybe the rest of East Asia?), but is certainly not well-known elsewhere, which is likely why you have never heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;

Why is Byakuya the only one in &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt; to have so many different techniques contained in his Zanpakut&#333;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="694">&lt;p&gt;They are various forms of his bankai, achieved by arranging the blades in different patterns. His bankai is versatile by nature (being composed of countless tiny blade fragments), and affords him several forms, with varying combination of attack and defense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a bankai can have multiple forms depends on its nature. Hitsugaya Toshiro and Abarai Renji &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; also achieve multiple bankai forms with practice/training. The former could mold Hyorinmaru's ice into various forms (like &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/fairy-tail" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'fairy-tail'" rel="tag"&gt;fairy-tail&lt;/a&gt;'s Gray), while the latter could rearrange Zabimaru's segments. Shinigami such as Komamura, Tousen, or Soifon would likely not have multiple bankai forms due to the nature of their bankai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Byakuya is no longer the only known shinigami with multiple bankai forms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; as Yamamoto Shigekuni's bankai has been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Byakuya's sister, Rukia, has &lt;em&gt;shikai&lt;/em&gt; with multiple forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Tsukishiro, Hakuren, Shirafune, and Juhaku &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="716">&lt;p&gt;Byakuya is not the only one with multiple techniques for his Zanpakut&#333;. All main characters seem to have multiple techniques and probably the others as well but we have not seen it (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this is due to (heavy) training, as goes with everything: When you train a lot you gain more experience, increase your skills and gain more insight how to you your skills. This all results in new ideas how to use a weapon and thus in multiple techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters climb in class rank when they show enough skill (and there is a 'free spot'), so when looking at the other way around: the high(er) ranked characters are likely to have a high(er) skill set and thus multiple techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="35755" Title="What is the Ash-Greninja form of Greninja?" Body="&lt;p&gt;This new form of Greninja is circulating around. I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; following the anime or the movies so please try to be gentle if it was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What exactly is this Greninja? If it's a mega-evolution, how did it get there without a stone? How exactly does his powers/abilities/skills vary from other normal Greninja?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know the physical difference, that it starts to resemble Ash a bit. Easily noticeable is the red middle part on his head instead of the body blue.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the normal Greninja: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/A4Fhv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/A4Fhv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Normal Greninja&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And this is Ash's:  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/auRdX.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/auRdX.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ash-Greninja&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35756">&lt;p&gt;Basically, what happens is that the bond between Ash and Greninja is so strong that Greninja took the new form as Ash-Greninja where Greninja takes some features of Ash (as you mentioned) and it is not a mega evolution. Some theorists say that it might be synchro evolution from the pokemon spin off &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Reburst&lt;/em&gt;. By turning into this form, Greninja's power greatly increases and as you can see on its back, there is a giant shuriken which is a replacement for water shuriken (the move). The Ash-Greninja form can only last for a short period of time before Ash and Greninja gets tired and faint, during the form ash can also feel the pain that Greninja is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official website explanation is "Ash's Greninja takes on a mysterious new appearance in the latest season! Ash-Greninja is the form that Greninja takes when the bond between it and Ash is raised to the limit. The strength of their bond changes Greninja's appearance, and it takes on the characteristic look of Ash's attire. This phenomenon is also said to have happened just once several hundred years ago in the Kalos region, but it remains shrouded in mystery."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime explanation is saying pretty much the same thing. When it first happened in the ninja village, the anime explained that because the bond between is great, he has taken a new form. The first appearance looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a0bFUl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a0bFUl.png" alt="Ash-Greninja first appearance"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;during this stage, Stallone did a lot of testing where he discovered that this transformation will take place only when Greninja and Ash have mentally synchronized. Then later in episode 25, while versing the kalos champion, Ash-Greninja got the full form and it looked like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5tgjm.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5tgjm.jpg" alt="Ash-Greninja full form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was then explained that this was when the bond became maximum level where they are completely synchronized. And then it goes through the phases of difficulty between Ash Greninja and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some power ups include faster, stronger, giant water shuriken, using water ninja knife things instead of the normal iyarigiri move. And in the episode 35, water shuriken became huge (kind of like rasen shuriken), it looked like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVsFLl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVsFLl.png" alt="Ash-Greninja water shuriken"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about Ash-Greninja is explained in the anime, it also shows Stallone testing how it works and the road to master this form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;Pokemon XY &amp;amp; Z&lt;/em&gt;. The anime has improved a lot, Ash is no longer the immature young kid, he seems (mentally) more as a teen now and yeah, I definitely think you should give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38037">&lt;p&gt;Ash Greninja's form requires them to be in sake and synchronized together, once he took full form the water shuriken on Greninja's back is a symbol of its strength which can mean that Ash and Greninja have a strong bond and makes them battle together as one.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44344">&lt;p&gt;When Ash went to challenge the Anystar Gym, he and his friends were attacked by one of Olympias assistant's [Carrie]. Ash battled her with Frogadier and Pikachu and won the battle. As she was about to use another Pokemon, Olympia stopped her in her tracks. Olympia's other assistant [Charlene] tells Carrie off for her actions towards the Ash and his friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they find out that Olympia is the gym leader of the Anystar gym, she has a vision of Frogadiers future. So they then go to gym and Olympia explains "Its power will become greater and greater". Then when Ash asked "Does that mean Frogadier will become Greninja?", Olympia says "Umm, that.. I don't know. However I do know this it will reach new heights that no one has never seen before and the two of you will reach those new heights together". Professor Sycamore asked "Could you mean Mega Evolution?", everyone gasp in surprise and Ash asked "Mega Evolution?". Professor Sycamore states "Though no one has ever seen a Greninja that could mega evolve". Clement says excitedly "That's  incredible! A new power that no one has ever seen before is a really BIG deal!" Serena says "Not just a BIG deal it's a HUGE deal!" Bonnie cries out "I can't wait for that to happen" Then Ash says confidently to Frogadier "Then lets go the future is out there just waiting for use!" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ash' Greninja is a very important character in the &lt;em&gt;XYZ&lt;/em&gt; series and it's when Ash and Greninja's emotions are in sync that Ash-Greninja appears. When Ash and his friends reunite with Sanpei and his Greninja, they all go to Sanpei's home, Ninja Village, and go over to Sanpei's room, then Dedenne and Squishy go down a trapdoor and Ash, Sanpei and the others follow and find themselves in a secret room. Sanpei's older brothers Ipai [the oldest] and Niai [the 2nd oldest] show Ash and his friends a temple with a picture of the ninja hero [A Greninja]. Bonnie states "But that Greninja is different then other Greninja I've seen before!" Clement said "Yeah, that's true"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ash Greninja is a very special pokemon and one of a kind, but sadly Ash-Greninja has left Ash to get read of the rest of the vines in kalos.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="799" Title="Why is Koga so different from Inuyasha?" Body="&lt;p&gt;When Inuyasha used a Shikon Jewel Shard he became a full demon and was dangerous to all of those who were close to him (probably because of the hatred and anger of his corrupted shard) but Kagome stopped him.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also Inuyasha has become a full demon in the past even without the help of a Shikon Jewel Shard.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My question is: If Koga (or anyone else who is a full demon) can control his emotions and his temper, even when regularly using the Shikon Jewel Shards, why can't Inuyasha do the same?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="882">&lt;p&gt;I believe it's mainly because it's those hatred and anger feelings which drive him into his full demon state in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme of transformation over anger is visible in many animes: Naruto, Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is because he's already angry/hateful, and the extra "evilness" the transformation gives him make him lose control entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28148">&lt;p&gt;From what I understand (and it has been a while since I watched but its a fav of mine) no one other that Kagome or Kikyo are the only ones who can safely handle the shikon no tama without befoming corrupted. Kaede explains to Kagome early on in the first season that the Jewel will corrupt even men who mean only to use its power for good, not just demons; that only in Kaygome's position are the shards safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;um Inuysha is half human and his father was one of the most powerful demons. Koga is just a wolf demon, I assume inuysha is much more powerful because of his father.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28158">&lt;p&gt;A major difference between Inuyasha and several others when it comes to the jewel shard's effects is that Inuyasha is heavily influenced by his human side, having been raised by his mother until her death and without a full blooded relative around to teach him control of his demon side. I've noticed that half demons in the show can lean towards either being more like their human side or demon side. Jinenji and Inuyasha would lead towards their human sides with their love for their human mothers whom raised them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naraku on the other hand chose his demon side through and through which is only displayed so surely whenever we see him try to suppress or throw away Onigumo's human feelings for Kikyo. As such, his becoming full demon in power has little effect on his mind because he's already using that side's state of mind to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Inuyasha's demon blood was never trained properly and said blood is so potent to begin with, his more baser instincts are what come out when it over powers his human side. (This potency and his expected death is actually why Inuyasha's father had Tetsaiga passed on to Inuyasha because he knew the results that would come if his demon blood overpowered his human blood in life or death situations) Demons are much more blood thirsty than humans, paticularly those lower class and weaker demons who have not developed a higher order of thinking which is why they are often referred to a little more than "savage beasts". Sesshomaru has had centuries training and controlling and evolving those instincts and power with the supposed assistance and overview of both parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koga too is very in tune with his wolf-ish animal instincts before he even gains his shards, and everyone else who does not seem to have major effects mentally seem to already know their place in the world and do not have questions on where they stand like Inuyasha who is constantly torn from his years of shunning in both races to wanting the jewel at all just so he can fit in to one category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Kagome and the crew have thrown him for a huge loop with their ease in accepting every part of who he is now, which completely throws off everything he's learned about his kind in the eyes of just about everyone else in Feudal Japan. (And that's about 150 years of being rejected by everyone but his mom and Kikyo)&lt;/p&gt;

They collide and goal. It doesn't look like one came flying from another table. As I know there will be only one puck in a single game on a table. So what is going on in this part? Does air hockey have different gameplay rules in Japan? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is really going on here? Can someone explain about two pucks at once on a single table?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28116">&lt;p&gt;A typical air hockey match consists of using two pushers and one puck. And as @jphager2 suggests in his comment, there's no need for a net in an air hockey match, hence, it could be a multi-purpose table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's the deal with two pucks? Now, in that Chapter, Raku and Chitoge had a lot of fun in the arcade. And the bill had to be a decent amount. So instead of someone willingly agreeing to pay the bill, they keep a match on condition that the loser has to pay for all the games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the the stakes were high, it is most likely that they used two pucks to increase the difficulty of the game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like @mirroroftruth says in their comment, the two pucks could also be a symbolic representation of Raku and Chitoge themselves. No matter how much they try to distance themselves, they always end up coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not completely different. Sometimes the differences are pins, ribbon, indoor slippers, tie, and so on. But, what does the reason behind this? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watch some Japanese dramas. But, couldn't recall any title that has those differences.&#10;Is this really part of Japanese culture? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: In my country, most students wear uniform too. But there's no differences of uniform between first, second, and third graders.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27578">&lt;p&gt;In my country (Indonesia), our school uniform has a badge that indicates what grade we are. It was not just my school, other schools here also have it like this. Thus, this is not/no longer (since Indonesia used to be under the occupation of the Japanese forces) a Japanese specific culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to why we have it that way, a page in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_school_uniform"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; explained it well. Basically, the uniform was modeled after the sailor uniform. The difference between Freshman, Junior, and Senior uniform rooted back from the rank hierarchy in the army. Think of advancing class as advancing in rank, like from a Sergeant into a Major, and then General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Added from the Tomato Cabal Line group discussion (credit to Krazer), the color on the uniforms and shoes denote the year the students belong in. The color is rotated each year. E.g. the color of the graduated senior becomes the color of the new incoming freshman. This is so that you can tell who is your senior and who is your junior. The color is rotated so that you don't have to change color every year.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;During the Chimera Ant arc of &lt;em&gt;HxH&lt;/em&gt;, we witness the awesome battle between Meruem or the chimera ant king, and &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Isaac Netero.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the end,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Netero is defeated by the king's might (some may argue that Netero still won with the hidden bomb, but in essence and for this post, I am going to conclude that Meruem defeated Netero).  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Netero&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;could not defeat Meruem, is there a nen user in the &lt;em&gt;HxH&lt;/em&gt; universe that could? Perhaps someone from the main cast, such as Gon, Killua, Kurapika, etc., a lesser character, such as Ging, Kite, Illumi, etc., or maybe a character that was only briefly mentioned and not fully developed?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35662">&lt;p&gt;Just from the point of the show, it is clear that the only character with a chance of beating Meruem in 1v1 is....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adult Gon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Pitou admitted that the insane power up may even challenge Meruem and thus sacrificed herself.&lt;br&gt;You should find this reddit pretty interesting. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/3da8ax/how_well_would_adult_gon_do_against_meruem/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Reddit: Adult Gon vs Meruem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvZ1Q.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvZ1Q.jpg" alt="Adult Gon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other characters with a chance/broken abilities are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chrollo Lucifer:&lt;/strong&gt; The leader of phantom troupe with a most broken ability. There is no limit to the power of Chrollo and hence he will be the first in this list. Given the right circumstances and planning, he is sure to make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zeno Zoldyck:&lt;/strong&gt; At least as powerful as Netero, the head of master assassins Zoldyck is surely VERY powerful and capable of standing up to Meruem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However once, Meruem absorbed Pouf and Youpi, I doubt anyone could have beaten him in the HxH universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From another answer, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to a fight between Nen users, pure power doesn't mean everything. One may have an ability than can overpower a type of opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other then the anime, there have been host of new characters recently shown for the dark continent arc that can have an impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are indications Maha Zoldyck is more powerful than Zeno or Netero. He definitely was at some point but is Zeno's grandfather. Like many other characters we don't actually have enough data to say. &#8211; kaine &lt;br&gt;
  I didn't remember Maha from the show. Haven't read the manga before the HxH_2011, I couldn't honestly comment on it, since Maha does not appear during the Yorkshin arc in the 2011 anime. However Wikia makes an interesting comment on him and he may well defeat Meruem if he was on his peak&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maha is the only known Enhancer in the Zoldyck family. In his youth he was incredibly powerful, to the point that Isaac Netero, once considered the strongest fighter in the world, received praise just for surviving a fight against him: he was, in fact, the only person that far to challenge Maha and live to tell the tale. It is unknown if his strength has waned with old age. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35820">&lt;p&gt;I guess in my mind, it depends on what you mean by "defeated."  If you are assuming a actual 1v1 fight, very few likely have a chance. Those that might have a chance would be as follows:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adult Killua:&lt;/strong&gt;  The story has not gotten that far yet, but it's &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; he has very similar potential to Adult Gon.  With his Godspeed/Lightning abilities, his highly logical/tactical combat measures, and his incredible physical strength, he might have the tools to overpower Meruem.  (Assuming Meruem stayed only as strong as we saw him in the anime/manga).  I believe being able to constantly stunlock an opponent nearly forever with his kind of combat skills absolutely gives him a chance. (He might even have MORE Nen abilities in the future as well.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adult Gon:&lt;/strong&gt;  As Arcane stated in his answer, this is pretty accurate. Also why Pitou decided Gon must be taken out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Chrollo Lucifer:&lt;/strong&gt; While Chrollo has a nice toolkit, I really don't believe that as he is now, he stands a chance against Meruem.  If he could learn a LOT more abilities, and gain a lot more power?  Maybe, but even then, how does he compensate for the speed and strength disparity being a Specialist?  He would absolutely have to surprise him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Shalnark:&lt;/strong&gt;  Assuming that super strong aura doesn't negate abilities on its own, AND assuming that Shalnark could surprise Meruem somehow, AND that he lands his dart.  Then yes, Shalark could win, simply because he could then simply have Meruem tear himself apart.  I still somehow find this scenario unlikely though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Maha Zoldyck:&lt;/strong&gt; As the only enhancer in the Zoldyck clan, and able to fight Netero to a standstill in the past, he's very strong.  But he's also very very old now, and it's unlikely he could do it is his current state.  When he was at his prime?  Possibly, but the same could be said for Netero as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Zeno Zoldyck:&lt;/strong&gt; The official power charts, and just observation in the anime as well, seem to conclude that he would not be able to beat Meruem.  Zeno is strong sure, and his battle experience is very high, however, even he admitted Chrollo would take him in a serious fight.  Given these facts, it seems unlikely he could defeat Meruem in any capacity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Unknown Random Nen User:&lt;/strong&gt; Given that the series doesn't cover ALL nen users in the world, it's possible that there is someone out there who COULD do it, even if we don't know who they are (This answer is here merely for the sake of completeness).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW, that said....  &lt;strong&gt;If you are talking outside of battle?&lt;/strong&gt;  Then there is someone who can do this easily.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Alluka Zoldyck:&lt;/strong&gt;  She's essentially the strongest Nen user in the series, and possibly the &lt;em&gt;strongest&lt;/em&gt; character in that world period.  As long as she's not surprised, Alluka/Something could simply let Killua use her power in command form to kill Meruem, and there's nothing he could do about it.  Her power is simply too much for a normal person to overcome, it's essentially a wish/cosmic scale as far as we were shown.  ONLY if Meruem knew of this, and could surprise her could he come out victorious.  She wins in basically any other scenario.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 In a way, this also makes the further story a little lame concerning Killua seeing as that he has full control of this power, he's essentially invincible now. The both of them could even restore Gon's Nen if they so chose.  She's basically a demi-goddess without battle powers as far as I'm concerned.  I understand the author wrote himself into a corner and Alluka was the solution, but it also could harm the impact of future works if the answer to any one of Kilua's or Gon's problem is:  "Alluka could fix that in a second."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40504">&lt;p&gt;Why is everyone neglecting Hisoka while still considering Chrollo? Also, no one has mentioned Ging who as Kite said is the strongest Hunter in the &lt;em&gt;HxH&lt;/em&gt; universe as far as he knows. While Something was doing her thing, everyone but Ging was freaking out. He knew, understood, and did not fear that power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think while Meruem is something unusual and powerful, his ability to learn was exceptional but he could still lose, that is something that was so significant with Komugi. She was insignificant in every way except Gungi. The king was an excellent fighter, but he wasn't very experience. So here is my list for people who could potentially beat him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chrollo&lt;/strong&gt;: Not enough information is given since we don't know all of his spells, still he could have something in that book stronger than Kurapika's chain that would work against ants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hisoka&lt;/strong&gt;: We know very little about his powers. Other than that where he may lack in power, he is a genius and smarter than the average bear. His dodgeball battle with Razor where he did very little, it was assumed he couldn't throw the ball but no one even asked. It served as a checkpoint for him to see where Killua and Gon were in their training. When Gon was knocked out, he said "he wanted total victory, right Gon?" while using his sticky gum to LAUNCH the ball back at Razor and sticking it to his arm. He could've done this at any point and single-handedly won the game. While I'm unsure of whether he could beat Meruem since we haven't seen his limits tested, it's safe to assume he'd stand a better chance than people are giving him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now people I think have a high chance of beating Meruem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zeno&lt;/strong&gt;: do you need an explanation? He said Netero was stronger than him, but Netero said that Knov and Morel were probably stronger than he was. You can't go based on what is said specifically, but rather what is shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gon&lt;/strong&gt;: Pitou said so before he even transformed. Everyone else covered the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ging&lt;/strong&gt;: this is pretty self-explanatory, we don't have enough information as we literally have no idea what he can do. However, he basically made it clear nothing was left for them on their world. Realizing the significance of Meruem being there, had he seen him as an actual threat, he probably would have shown up, he knew how it was going to go through, so he was like fuck it. If the anime/manga ever continues and shows his progress going into the New World I think you guys will see he -- of all people -- deserves recognition. While being a shit father as an individual, he is clearly a fucking monster. He is the only one I would bet my money on to win without much of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43549">&lt;p&gt;I will just clarify: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hisoka doesn't have the firepower to beat Meruem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrollo doesn't as well, although considering his ability he can use Sphinx's Cyclotron and some of his friends abilities to aid him, and he will need to set up an environment where he can win. However, in a straight up 1v1 no planning? He gets wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other Hunter has displayed Meruem like powers even Gon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the answer is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;, none have shown as of yet at least.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="46572">&lt;p&gt;The other answers may be theoretically correct (adult Gon and Nanika are the most promising, though Nanika's status as a nen user is unclear and thus may be disqualified), however there is one Nen user who we know was capable of seemingly trivially defeating Meruem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am speaking, of course, of Komugi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts in Hunter x Hunter need not be based on combat. Certainly it is a common setting for it but we have also had dodgeball games, jogs, arm wrestling, and so on. When Meruem challenged the national masters of various board games, the stakes were clearly life and death and it is clear that the other masters were defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Komugi was also definitely a nen user, as we see her gain the ability to perceive nen and she developed powers related to Gungi. That many of her victories took place without the use of Nen is irrelevant as the question does not require the person to use nen for their victory, merely to have the ability.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49610">&lt;p&gt;Throughout the hunter series, there are people who are speculated to be god-class in power. Meruem himself is of course one such being. Alluka is another obvious example. I can list a few others in this category to give you a gist. In my view, only with power of such a class can one defeat the ant king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Freecs (the grandfather of Ging) is one character who can be ascribed such a power level. He is strong enough to live in the dark continent permanently; constantly charting and mapping the area and writing books about the species and wonders found there. Mind you, the dark continent is where the chimera ants originate from. The continent contains creatures so deadly that they make the chimera ants seem like insignificant mere miniature ants by comparison; thus for a nen user to be powerful enough to choose to dwell there, then he must be a good contender to fight and defeat Meruem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kite's new identity as Meruem's sister, gives her the immense nen capabilities of a chimera ant Princess, effectively placing him in the god class category capable of fighting an ant king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventhough it is unconfirmed, there is reason to believe that the sonata of darkness which deformed Melody, was not written by the devil himself but was in fact written by a nen user whose power is so vile that it could easily be referred to as devilish. A being of such power could also be a good contender against Meruem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone of Netero's power level (for instance, anyone in the legendary seirin group) uses a nen restriction (ie: takes a leaf from Gon's book) during battle, that individual should then be powerful enough to defeat the ant king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maha Zoldyck in his prime was an assassin like we have never seen before. There was almost no method of death dealing in the grim reaper's arsenal that Maha could not dish out. He would be the only guy I would tip to be capable of 'dwelling successfully' in the dark continent (aside Don Freecs of course); indeed, "god-class" was not out of his purview. However, given that Netero 'survived' a battle with Maha, the ant king would most likely survive him too. They could be equal in combat, but I doubt Maha could dish out a true defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are abilities in the hunter universe that could instantly make one a god-level combatant. In fact, I believe Killua even mentioned one in the greed island arc when he stated that the combination of risky dice and fickle genie could make an individual quite powerful. It would be akin, or the same effect as someone who wished for Alluka to grant them a power/ability/strength capable of defeating the ant king.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;As for the reason why Shinji choked Asuka, I stick with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/mdwigs/KimochiWarui.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the translation of &quot;Kimochi warui&quot; card from Eva card game&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm willing to accept other theories,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Shinji renounced the world where all hearts had melted into one and accepted each other unconditionally. His desire... to live with 'others' -- other hearts that would sometimes reject him, even deny him. That is why the first thing he did after coming to his senses was to place his hands around Asuka's neck. To feel the existence of an 'other'. To confirm (make sure of) rejection and denial.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I have no clear explanation of why did Asuka caress Shinji when he is strangling her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34187">&lt;p&gt;So, so many possible reasons. I refer to movies like &lt;em&gt;End of Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Madoka: Rebellion&lt;/em&gt; as "make your own ending kits"; due to their constant use of symbolism and ambiguous dialogue, combined with a pathological aversion to explaining themselves, you can basically interpret them to mean whatever you want them to. If I may be allowed a bit of shameless self-promotion, I recently &lt;a href="https://metatris.blogspot.com/2016/06/evangelion-iii-end-of-eva.html" rel="noreferrer"&gt;wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt; doing just that. I didn't specifically analyze why Asuka caressed Shinji, but going by the interpretation I adopted in my post, along with the mentioned card game translation, there are a few valid reasons why she did that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scene echoes one earlier in the movie, during Instrumentality, when Shinji and Asuka are arguing with each other about whose fault it is that they never managed to get close. I summarized the scene on my blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Shinji] zeros in on Asuka in particular, isolating her in a dream version of Misato&#8217;s kitchen and fighting with her as Pen-Pen looks on, responding to her accusations that he didn&#8217;t know her at all that he couldn&#8217;t possibly know her, because she never talks about herself, and how unreasonable it is for her to expect him to know her when she won&#8217;t tell him anything. Rei appears and asks if he ever tried, and Shinji responds that he did, but couldn&#8217;t. Asuka asks how she could like someone who doesn&#8217;t even love himself. Shinji responds that maybe he could learn to love himself if she tried being nice to him, gets angry and smashes a chair, then wraps his hands around her neck and strangles her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinji, who has spent a large part of the series being passive and self-loathing, finally gets angry and blames Asuka (and by proxy the other people in his life) for his inability to get close to others. Asuka and Rei respond, with some justification, that Shinji also has to take some blame; he avoids getting close to anyone because he fears being rejected and abandoned by them, as he was by his father. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Shinji manages to get over his fear of rejection and chooses to reverse Instrumentality and go back to the world where people are separate and can choose to reject or abandon each other. The card translation says that Shinji started to strangle Asuka because he wanted to confirm that rejection and denial exist once more. By going back to a world where rejection and denial exist, Shinji has admitted that he feared them, and faced that fear. He has confessed that Asuka's and Rei's accusations in the earlier scene were true, that he locked people out too tightly because he feared abandonment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Shinji strangles Asuka, she reaches up and caresses him, countering that although rejection and denial exist again, acceptance also exists again&#8212;people have the choice to accept others into their hearts, just as they have the choice to deny others. And with this, Asuka confesses that Shinji's accusations in the earlier scene were true: Asuka resisted, at every level, accepting Shinji (and by proxy, everyone) into her heart, by yelling at him, demeaning him, and violently rejecting the rudimentary efforts he did make to get closer to her. But now that Shinji's managed to stop fearing rejection from everyone, Asuka's learned to stop rejecting everyone. Shinji knows he can't passively wait for someone to accept him; Asuka knows that she can't keep rejecting everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing that Asuka intends to stop rejecting him, Shinji breaks down in tears. Asuka responds "Kimochi warui"; to accept someone feels weird, foreign, and disgusting to her, because she's always resisted it. At various points in the series, Shinji and Asuka almost manage to get closer&#8212;in Episode 15, Asuka compliments Shinji on his cello playing and then forces him to kiss her, but then violently rejects him by feigning disgust and running to the bathroom to wash her mouth out. Shinji doesn't realize that Asuka was sincerely trying to get closer to him, or he realizes it, but won't follow up because he's afraid of being rejected. In Episode 22, after seeing her talk on the phone with her stepmother, Shinji tries to have a real conversation with Asuka about family, but Asuka is all pissed off because Shinij surpassed her sync ratio. In the final scene of &lt;em&gt;End of Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;, they both realize their own culpability in the situation and decide to start trying to become people who are able to accept one another.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47509">&lt;p&gt;I like all that analogy on &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/34187/2516"&gt;Torisuda's answer&lt;/a&gt;, but there seems to be missing a piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While during the instrumentality, all beings become one no matter how brief it is. All of them experienced what it was like to be one entity and because of that oneness, everyone experienced the flaw that comes with being wholesome being. Since everyone became one, there were no secrets to be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why Asuka said "disgusting" because while they were one, she found out and knew what he did to her unconscious body. Because of that, the first thing she said when she saw him was "disgusting".&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="55882">&lt;p&gt;I rewatched the series after 19 years and just saw End of Evangelion for the first time. My theory is that Shinji is actually attempting to do something for Asuka instead of reacting in a way to avoid conflict and pain. The first time he chokes her, she goes limp and the scene ends. But we can see in many scenes that Asuka's mother choked the doll she was pretending to be Asuka, asking her (the doll) to die together. Asuka is tormented by the fact that her mother rejected her so Shinji choking her is a reenactment for Asuka's sake, which was hinted that that's what she subconsciously desired from the first time it happened. It doesn't mean that she really wants to be choked to death, it's just a deep-seeded irrational desire she had that her mother had choked her instead of the doll, because at least her mother would be paying attention to her. Pretty fucked up, but it's a very good illustration of the irrational desires people harbor due to insecurities embedded from different developmental stages in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact 2: Pentagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pentagram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a five-sided star, usually made with a single continuous line, with the points equally spaced. It is often depicted within a circle. This is one of several geometric star designs representing the mysteries of creation and redemption, the soul of man in its relationship with the Universal Spirit. Magickally, such diagrams are considered efficacious in rites and rituals of evocation and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Among the Greeks, the pentagram was the symbol of the goddess Kore, who resumed in her mythos the descent and ascent of the human of soul from the Underworld. Her sacred symbol, the apple, shows a five-pointed star when sliced horizontally through the center. The Pythagoreans, who based much of their philosophy on numbers, used the pentagram as an amulet for health and spiritual well-being. They wore the pentagram both upright and reversed and when hiding from persecution, they used the pentagram as a secret sign of recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;By the Middle Ages, the pentagram had become a general symbol of spiritual wisdom and truth, and it was marked on doorways and windows to keep evil out of the house. There is evidence that the old village witches made use of the pentagram, which they called the Witches' Foot, the Druid's Foot or the Goblin's Cross. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The Church decided it was no longer proper for Christians to use the symbol after the Christian Inquisition began burning village wise women and identifying them by the sign of pentagram. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;After the invention of the printing press and subsequent publication of Agrippa's Occult Philosophy and numerous magickal grimoires, the pentagram became a popular symbol of occult knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;And to add to this, there are apparently two different types of pentagram or pentacle. An upright and an inverted pentagram:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;upright pentagram&lt;/strong&gt; is a 5 pointed star with one point aligned upwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;inverted pentagram&lt;/strong&gt; is a 5 pointed star with two points aligned upwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inverted pentagrams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are largely associated with Baphomet, an imagined pagan deity (in other words, a product of Christian folklore concerning pagans), which is revived in the 19th century as a figure of occultism and Satanism. Often mistaken for Satan, it represents the duality of male and female, as well as Heaven and Hell or night and day signified by the raising of one arm and the downward gesture of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Its name may have come from two Greek words, baphe and metis, meaning "absorption of knowledge." It has also been called the &lt;strong&gt;Black Goat, Devil's Goat, Goat Head, Goat of Mendes,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Judas Goat&lt;/strong&gt;. Its first appearance appears to have been during the vicious interrogation of members of the Knights Templar by the Roman Catholic Church during the Inquisition. There was little consensus among different victims' descriptions of the Baphomet. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It can probably be safely assumed that their description of the Baphomet is more a product of the Inquisition's torture methods than of any actual statue that was in use by the Knights... &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact 3: Writing within the Pentagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Magicians also use the pentagram as a part of the Solomon Lamen (Seal of Solomon), which is composed of three sigils: the Pentagram, the Hexagram and the Secret Seal (a Mercurial symbol). In this lamen, worn as a necklace by the magician when invoking spirits, the pentagram is used to open a doorway to spiritual forces. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The words on the seal have the following meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I conjure thee in secret, O Spirit!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ballaton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Come forth from thy abode and speak clearly in my speech.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bellony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Put forth thy might and discover unto me the knowledge and power in thy keep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halliy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Answer in the inward silence all of my questions without fail.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halliza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Assume and show forth unto me thy form of divine perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soluzen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Open unto me thy secret door and fulfill me of my purpose!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Gatchaman Crowds&quot;, the main protagonist is a 16-year old girl named Hajime Ichinose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Hajime fights in Gatchaman mode, she has several attacks: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blanc et Noir (&quot;Black and White&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Petits Ciseaux (&quot;Little scissors&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Balles Patsels&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wings de l'Avenir (&quot;Wings of the future&quot; - a mix of English and French since the French word for &quot;Wings&quot; is &quot;Ailes&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Grand Ciseaux (&quot;Big scissors&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(The attacks where listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gatchaman.wikia.com/wiki/Hajime_Ichinose&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gatchaman Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Balles Patsels&quot; may be a misspelling - maybe it was &quot;balles pastels&quot;, &quot;Pastel-colored balls&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;scissors&quot; theme is logical, since one of Hajime's favorite spare-time activities is Kirigami.&lt;br&gt;&#10;What's remarkable is the names of the attacks: the other Gatchaman team members have attacks with Japanese or English names, but Hajime's attacks have French names.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, why do Hajime's attacks have French names? Is this ever explained in the series?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="24116">&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly based on the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rule of Cool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Manga and anime frequently contain specialized jargon, names of attacks and locations in foreign languages simply because it sounds 'cool' and different to the Japanese ear: e.g. Spanish (&lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt;), German (&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;), English (most of them) or multiple (&lt;em&gt;Full Metal Panic&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Gatchaman&lt;/em&gt;, there may be an additional reason for using French for Ichinose's attacks specifically: to emphasize her femininity and artistic side. French is often associated with delicacy, grace, and the arts (e.g. ballet, couture, visual design, performance art, etc), and so may be a hint towards her "gentler nature" (chauvanism does still appear in anime). Her artistic side is also referenced by attacks related to her crafts hobbies, as you've mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="4350" Title="What started the trend of 3-5 minute long episodes for anime series?" Body="&lt;p&gt;It seems there's a lot of these short (e.g. 3-5 minute long) anime series recently, specifically ones that air on TV (as opposed to ONA's). Shows like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireball_%28anime%29&quot;&gt;Fireball/Fireball Charming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi%27s_Sweet_Home&quot;&gt;Chii's Sweet Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encouragement_of_Climb&quot;&gt;Encouragement of Climb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_and_Randsell&quot;&gt;Recorder and Ransell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiura&quot;&gt;Aiura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And an older one, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Gi_Charat&quot;&gt;Di Gi Charat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What started the trend of short 3-5 minute per episode TV series. How does that fit into a regular TV time-slot if it's so short?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4356">&lt;p&gt;They channel airing the show would just shift things forward or backward 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So something that normally starts at 12:00 would start at 12:05. The shows in the evening will start at the usual time by, over the course of the day, removing 1 or 2 adverts each advert break. The channels that keep a strict schedule just remove most of the adverts during an advert break and play the show then. They do not allocate a 30 minute slot to a short. However, if they have a 15 minute show, they would play that directly before or after the short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channels make a lot of money from adverts so they only remove adverts for series they expect to get a high viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what started it, I can not say, but while I can not remember any, I am sure I have seen shorts that aren't anime, but the vast majority would probably be anime.
I think the main reason we see more shorts is because anime companies are getting bolder due to more sponsors and producing more franchise such as games and figurines etc., but I think mostly due to larger viewing numbers. 10 years ago companies might have had a hard time making profit on a short and so channels would not want to air them, but now more money means they can get better music, scripts and animation for shorts (or any other things that make them worth watching) so channels will want to air them.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="25918">&lt;p&gt;Japanese television is common to have short series. Most drama episodes are only 10 minutes long. It's just something to watch daily in the morning or something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a channel at 9:00 shows a few different series and usually, the short ones are all crammed into one drama viewing period. After all the short episodes are aired, something long like the news comes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it also helps a lot of people who are on a schedule and don't have time to dedicate half an hour of their day for a show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of these short anime are also taken from 4-koma manga, so the episode is like getting a comic strip in the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

I find it strange that the same voice actor would be cast to voice two different important characters in the same show. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sure, it's common for a voice actor to voice multiple side characters, I guess to reduce the total number of voice actors that need to be hired (e.g. from this season, Fukuyama Jun voices Hunchoceratops and a few side characters in Amagi Brilliant Park; and Kayano Ai voices a number of side characters in Shirobako). But two different main characters?

Body="&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of Ufotable's UBW adaptation, on the day Rin was going to summon Archer, the clocks happened to have moved backwards by one hour. She considered that it may have been her father's doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did the clocks move one hour backwards?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21935">&lt;p&gt;The explanation is kind of dumb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before Rin summoned Archer, she was rummaging through her father's effects in hopes of finding stuff that would be useful for the summoning. One of the things she found was the box containing the pendant (and, at least per the depiction in UBW 2014, the catalyst for Gilgamesh), protected by a magical MacGuffin that, when activated, makes clocks go wonky and apparently rewind by one hour. She activated the MacGuffin. The clocks rewound in two half-hour increments. She only noticed one of the half-hour increments. The end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasu later stated in an interview (in Complete Material 3) that this was apparently an intentional "test"-of-sorts on Tokiomi's part, the idea being that if she couldn't handle a minor issue like this, she wasn't cut out to be in the war. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes no chronological sense, because Tokiomi likely never expected Rin to be in the war in the first place (Tokiomi would have expected the fifth war to take place around 2060 or so, by which time Rin would have had descendants rather more sprightly than she), but there you have it. &lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't sound like Kansai Ben or the standard Tokyo dialect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5208">&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with Japanese dialectology, so all I can really tell is that (as &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5205/what-is-the-japanese-dialect-spoken-in-ghost-hound#comment4839_5205"&gt;Logan M noted&lt;/a&gt;) it's a dialect from Kyushu or thereabouts. Luckily, the internet seems to know more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1018838415" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This Chiebukuro entry&lt;/a&gt;, presumably written by a native speaker, thinks that it's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakata_dialect" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hakata&lt;/strong&gt; dialect&lt;/a&gt; (spoken in Fukuoka, Kyushu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://anime.goo.ne.jp/special/ghosthound/event_report_TIFF.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;This interview with Chiaki KONAKA&lt;/a&gt; (who did the screenplay for Ghost Hound) notes that the story's setting is inspired by &lt;strong&gt;Fukuoka&lt;/strong&gt;, and that effort was made to make the dialects portray the setting effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/review/R2OGNOK2YHFL9Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B000ZNTPPS&amp;amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;amp;nodeID=561958&amp;amp;store=dvd" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Some dude on Amazon Japan&lt;/a&gt; mentions how he can feel that the script has been modeled on the speech of the &lt;strong&gt;Fukuoka&lt;/strong&gt; area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is really authoritative, but it is suggestive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible source of confusion for us here is that it might be that people are just defaulting to describing the dialect in question as Fukuoka dialect since Fukuoka is the largest city in Kyushu (i.e. it's possible that the people I have linked above do not have direct experience distinguishing among varieties of Kyushu Japanese). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Aside - if you like the Kyushu dialect, you should watch &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakamichi_no_Apollon" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Lots&lt;/em&gt; of Kyushu Japanese in that one.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Episode 19 - &lt;em&gt;The Lugru Corridor&lt;/em&gt;, Kirito and Leafa are blocked from entering Lugru by Salamanders and are forced to fight with them. In the middle of the fight, Yui tells Leafa to use all her magic to heal Kirito from the damage of the incoming barrage of Fire Spells, while Kirito is chanting an Ilusion Spell that Leafa taught him when they entered the corridor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kirito turns into &lt;em&gt;The Gleam Eyes&lt;/em&gt; from Sword Art Online and begins to kill everyone (save one Salamander who Kirito then bribes with the loot he just got, while another fled by diving into the lake, only to die).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Leafa explained previously that Spriggan's spells are mostly useless in battle, and by definition Illusions shouldn't damage enemy players or even kill them (unless they are intimidated and back off falling into an abyss of a monster filled lake). If they could do damage, they'd technically be summoning/conjuring.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kirito isn't a hacker who made Leafa, Yui and all the Slamanders think that a giant beast was throwing them about, when really he was just stabbing them. And in Sword Art Online, Kirito didn't have any sort of summoning abilities (at least in the anime). So how did Kirito's Illusion pick up, throw and kill the Salamanders?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13988">&lt;p&gt;Rather than an illusion magic, it seems what Kirito used is a transformation magic instead. The following is based from the 3rd novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Well, I somehow remember the battle earlier. I used the magic Yui suggested, and became very big. Since my sword disappeared, I had to use my hands..."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Also with the teeth bite yo~"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;On Lyfa's shoulder, Yui added with pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that Yui is an AI from Aincrad and that upon arriving at the Alfheim world, Kirito noticed that Alfheim is based on Aincrad, including the skill sets and player data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the skills window, I saw several skills side by side. These skills included: 1-H Swords, Unarmed Skills, and Parry, the Combat skills, as well as Fishing, a support skill, but the proficiency values were abnormal. More were just about 900, and some had even reached 1,000 and had a tag denoting MASTERY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later when asking Yui, Yui confirmed that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"It seems this world is based on a copy of the Sword Art Online server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explains how Kirito can turn into The Gleam Eyes. Since it is a copy of the SAO, some resource file might be still left intact. While it is not normally accessible by the players, with Yui giving assist, it is possible that she hacked the system a bit and granted access to Kirito to transform into The Gleam Eyes. This wasn't explicitly mentioned in the novel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37277">&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget that the Salamanders' remain-lights were extinguished as soon as they were formed. This means that Kirito also got the special stats of the monster he became. GLEAM EYES was the first &lt;em&gt;demonic&lt;/em&gt; monster the SAO players faced, according to the wiki. In Alfheim this must mean that any damage a demonic monster does cannot be healed by magic and anyone it killed could not be revived, thus they all faced the penalties for dying in Alfheim with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; chance of escape through revival.  &lt;strong&gt;That's&lt;/strong&gt; pretty terrifying if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40032">&lt;p&gt;It is a spell called metamorphosis. Here's the description from the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Once the incantation is completed, the spell turns the caster into a monster. The shape of the monster that the player is transformed into depends randomly on the player's combat skills. However, this spell is not popular, as the end result is usually a weak monster with no change in stats, thus it is usually not viable in actual combat."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also an illusion spell.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43276">&lt;p&gt;From the scene, it seems implied that Yui had worked out a plan with Kirito to turn into the Gleam Eyes monster ("Do it now Daddy!").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It obviously isn't an illusion - he was killing other players with it.  The only possibility you're left with is that although Sprigins normally have only illusion magic, he had a special ability which gave him access to transform into to this beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Yui could not hack the systems as was mentioned earlier, the best we can say is that she recognized that he had higher level magic skills in his inventory that could be used to his advantage.  And although Leafa was generally aware of what Sprigins were capable of, she may not have been aware of what one at Kirito's power levels were capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I'd say he had the ability to transform into a real monster, given his ability, and perhaps Yui pointed this out to him and he made use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;There is a meme created from the &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; manga which details a character yelling at Matsuda and instructing him to swim.

What are they actually saying, and what chapter/episode is this event from?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3911">&lt;p&gt;This is a rather famous scene from episode 37 of Death Note. Parodies of the scene have become fairly common, including a &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/matsuda-you-idiot"&gt;Know Your Meme page&lt;/a&gt;. For an example, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2iwsIvwU_Q"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; has clips from the scene set to "Native Faith", the extra boss theme from Touhou 10. Misheard or altogether wrong lines from this scene are also common, as is the case in this particular GIF. Here's the original video; as a warning, it contains &lt;strong&gt;major spoilers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what's going on in the scene, again, it's very spoilery, but here's a description. It does not involve swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Yagami Light has just been found out as Kira, the serial murderer, who possesses a Death Note, a notebook with which he can kill anyone by writing their name in the book. Matsuda, a police officer, had a friendly relationship with Light (as well as looking up to Light's father the police chief), so discovering that Light was the criminal they were searching for all-along, and was responsible for his own father's death (as well as many others), was fairly shocking. Light, on the other hand, at this point has succumbed completely to his insane delusions of grandeur, and as he has no more tricks up his sleeve, he attempts to persuade the officers who have caught him to join forces with him, but comes off just looking even more insane. As a result of all of this, the scene is rather dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

Did I miss/misunderstand something?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13560">&lt;p&gt;There were two years between the moment they had escaped and the moment the bones were received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Saki was 14 years old, Maria and Mamoru escaped.
When Saki was 26 years old, she knew the council received the bones 9 or 10 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they were alive for 2 years.
This is enough time to create a child.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13566">&lt;p&gt;After Maria and Mamoru escapes from Kamisu 66th district, the story undergoes a time skip 12 years ahead, where Saki and Satoru are 26 years old&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, in episode 18, Asahina Tomiko, the head of Ethics Committee, reaffirmed the death of Maria and Mamoru. After they received the bones from Yakomaru/Squealer, they have checked that the bones are from human and there are no inconsistencies in age and gender. They even further confirmed by doing DNA tests and matching the dental record from Harmony School. Therefore, at the point when Saki and Satoru are 26 years old, &lt;strong&gt;both Maria and Mamoru have deceased&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not mentioned &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; they received the bones in the anime (or maybe I have missed it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only found reference in the manga&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (volume 4 chapter 13), where it was mentioned that the bones are recovered 2-3 year after their disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGusx.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGusxl.jpg" alt="Chapter 13"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is safe to conclude that during the period of 2-3 years, Maria and Mamoru had a child together, then Maria and Mamoru were killed by the queerats and had their bones sent back to the district. Their child was raised by the queerats, which made the child recognize the queerats as his/her&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; own species and enable him/her to freely massacre other humans. In the anime, the child is shown to be around 10 years old, which matches the timeline of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is confirmed by Wikipedia, both &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_%28novel%29#Characters"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A_%28%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AC%29#.E6.99.82.E7.B3.BB.E5.88.97.E3.83.BB.E5.90.84.E3.82.A8.E3.83.94.E3.82.BD.E3.83.BC.E3.83.89"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; version. In the summary of the chapter 5 of Japanese version: 12 years passed, Saki and Satoru are now 26 years old. (12&#24180;&#12364;&#36942;&#12366;&#12289;&#26089;&#23395;&#12392;&#35226;&#12399;26&#27507;&#12395;&#12394;&#12387;&#12390;&#12356;&#12383;&#12290;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; There are &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; differences between the manga and anime. However, the key part of the story remains: Maria and Mamoru leaves the district, their child raised by the queerats later helps the queerats attacking the village.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The child is male in the novel and female in the anime. According to cite note on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_%28novel%29#Characters"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="50781">&lt;p&gt;I mean the top answer's obviously what the writer was going for, but it has a plot hole in it, or at least it's not really believable.. The kids said they'd report Maria and T-whatever his name is as dead, Squealer suggested that they should say an avalanche killed them... Really? An avalanche killing 2 kids with superpowers? And on top of that, they'd have to see it actually happen, so, in order for this story to work, they'd have to have found them first, then either they agree to come back (unlikely, but hey, could be made believable), or, they run away again (the scenario that would've happened IF they found them). In the first scenario, the avalanche happening wouldn't have a time restriction, so sure, an avalanche randomly going off would be believable i guess. But it would have to kill ONLY those 2, again, nevermind their powers and all, BUT ALSO while the other 2 kids, WHO ALSO HAVE SUPERPOWERS, watch it all happen? Nope, nobody would buy that, the board would know somethings off.
In the second scenario tho, the avalanche would have to happen the exact same moment they decide to run away, which is really convenient isn't it? And again, 2 kids with superpowers doing nothing, the other 2 kids with superpowers just watching it happen. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that the board does buy their story though, searching for those bones would be the highest priority, the kids would probably be forced to show them where it all happened, which would narrow the area greatly obviously. Now they start the search from that area, and keep widening it. If they don't find it in like a month with their psychic-powers, the kids obviously lied, somethings off, they investigate, consequences. But let's imagine that in this world where grownups are paranoid as fuck, paranoid enough to kill innocent children, even their own at times, let's just imagine that they keep on searching forever without questioning it, and then dig the bones up in 2 years. Where would Squealer put them? A Queerat couldn't hide them deeper then the superpowered humans didn't already dig. So if they found the bones in layers above what they've searched, it would be obvious that they were put there recently. Again, let's imagine that the paranoid humans wouldn't notice this, and that the depth of it doesn't matter. Squealer could either put them where the kids said they saw the avalanche, or, somewhere random in that entire snowy biom. First case, it becomes obvious that the bones weren't there 2 years ago since it's been thoroughly investigated already. Second case, the kids lied and the bones were nowhere near, they get to the bottom of it (hypnosis etc.), smell something fishy's going on with Squealer, consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there's not a single way that this lie could be hidden from the board, and in turn saddens me cause it makes the story unrealistic :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if anyone were to die in an avalanche, their body wouldn't rot since it would be kept frozen until the snow started melting, so they wouldn't find bones, they'd find the entire body intact. Well, mostly. There have been cases of humans finding frozen bodies that were 500 years old. Would an educated society with access to all the previous civilizations knowledge miss that fact :) ? Doubt it, since anyone could deduct that using simple logic. Keep in mind that freezing to death probably happened in their civilization often, so they'd be even more aware of this fact then we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: -
       Just rewatched episode 18, apparently Squealer was the one who brought them the bones? So i guess I didn't even have to try and develop those other theories that had more potential of working out, the anime just decided to go with the one that's not possible at the slightest. A Queerat finding bones deep in the snow when superpowered humans couldn't, alright.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Usually we would treat the manga as canon for most works, but as most people usually only have watched the animation or played the video games, would in this case the manga still be considered canon over the anime? Or would it be the videogame and manga based on it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13152">&lt;p&gt;Canon usually refers to the &lt;em&gt;original work&lt;/em&gt; rather than the most popular one. As such, I would imagine that the original Japanese manga is canon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other mediums can be canon as well; the anime for example is a very important part of the franchise. Stil, the manga would probably still take precedence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canon is a very broad term that can be as strict or lenient as the user who uses it, so it's hard to answer this question definitively.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26271">&lt;p&gt;The video games, manga, and anime are all different stories. Each is canon only to it's own plot. Since the video game came first however, we can assume the video game is considered canon unless you are speaking directly about the anime or manga, in which case that universe takes precedence. In the absence of information from the video game, I would say information from the anime comes next, since it came out before the manga. (Though arguably the manga fits the games better then the anime, therefore it takes the spot at second most canonical.) It entirely depends on how you see the Pokemon universe.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Yoshimura is supposed to be this wise good old man, who was evil in the past. But he has a kakuja and it's mentioned in the Tokyo Ghoul wikia he had to cannibalize to obtain it. If I recall correctly, in the flashbacks when he was an evil ghoul it's never shown he having a kakuja. Did Yoshimura cannibalize after becoming &quot;a good guy&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49473">&lt;p&gt;This was not specifically discussed nor explained in the manga. But, in &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 119&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;it was mentioned that when Kuzen heard of the One-Oyed Owl, he took the One-Eyed Owl's place for fear that the organization, V, would find out that the Owl was his child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you notice while Yoshimura was telling Kaneki his past, he talks about it in a third-person point-of-view &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(by using 'Kuzen' instead of 'I'). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this might be just a style of telling a story, I interpreted it as his dissociation of his current self from his past self. He does not want to be seen as what he was in the past. Furthermore, notice how Yoshimura mentions this in &lt;strong&gt;Chapter 119&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'And so, Kuzen took the place of the One-Eyed Owl.'&lt;/em&gt; Not &lt;em&gt;'Yoshimura took the place of the One-Eyed Owl.'&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that Anteiku was established and he assumed the identity Yoshimura afterwards, this means that he cannibalized before becoming Yoshimura. While the &lt;a href="http://tokyoghoul.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshimura" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; mentions that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;he was already going by the name Yoshimura when he found out about his child, this was not directly stated nor explained in the manga as far as I know so I have no idea where the wiki gets its information. It was only mentioned that time passed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person&#8217;s face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;people sharing the same name will not be affected&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that Light was trying every possible spelling of the name, because at least one of them would match with the face pictured when he wrote the names. This also means that no collateral casualties would occur, as that particular person's face was being pictured in his mind.&lt;br&gt;
If I'm correct on this, &lt;strong&gt;the first column are different spellings for Shibuimaru, the second for Takuo, and the third column refers to the death&lt;/strong&gt; ("accidental death" (&#20107;&#25925;&#27515;) is what it says).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not have to try this out with his first victim because he got both his face and name from TV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, &lt;strong&gt;he was trying to match a name for that face by going through every possible spelling&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing in some info from the below comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This does not appear to violate the rule on rendering the Death Note void if the user misspells a person's name more than 4 times, if one of the first four spellings was correct (which seems to be the case).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6205">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6188/1908"&gt;JNat's answer&lt;/a&gt; is correct. Just to add a bit of info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variants of "Shibuimaru" that he tries are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#28171;&#20117;&#20024;
&#28171;&#20234;&#20024;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the differences in the middle character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variants of "Takuo" that he tries are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#25299;&#30007;
&#25299;&#22827;
&#25299;&#38596;
&#21331;&#30007;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we encounter another minor plot hole here (at least as shown in the anime) - Light stops writing after iterating over all 8 combinations of those names (the first of which, &lt;code&gt;&#28171;&#20117;&#20024; &#25299;&#30007;&lt;/code&gt;, turns out to be correct), when there are actually &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 2 more spellings of "Takuo" (&lt;code&gt;&#21331;&#22827;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#21331;&#38596;&lt;/code&gt;) that should've been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22219">&lt;p&gt;He wrote down the man's name 8 times, the first of which was correct. The next 7 attempts were other guesses at the spelling of Takuo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a rule in the death note stating that if a person intentionally writes a name incorrectly four times, that person will die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just like in "Death Note Onison", the intent to misspell is a key factor. In "Onison," L has Misa write his and his companions name's down four times. They do not die, however, because L knew Misa was illiterate, (at least in this version of Death Note) and she tried her best to spell the names correctly. Because she tried with intent to spell correctly, she did not die; Light Yagami did not die for the exact same reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light Yagami has found the perfect murder weapon, and unknowing almost killed himself in the process of trying it out. Had Takuo's name been written incorrectly over 4 times first by Light, and then one of the next four spelling been correct, Light may have been killed first, then Takuo. Light would die since he got the spelling wrong 4 times in a row before getting it right. Takuo would die because Light still got it right once, and a name written in a Death Note can never be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I have already stated that intent is required for the Death Note to be effective, evidence is only seen for this in "Onison," which was only a skit, and the word "intent" in the rule on the Death Note page describing that the person would die if it was written incorrectly four times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Light did truely intend to spell it correctly, he did know he would potentially misspell it as well. As we see in the Manga and the Series, the rules of the Death Note can be somewhat loose. If you figure out a particular rule by testing it, you can utilize it how Light did. However, we never see somebody incorrecly spell a name 4 times in a row to see what would happen to them, since Light got his very first guess right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, nobody knows what would have happened had Light been wrong more than 4 times before getting it right, since we never see what the Death Note would do in a situation like that. How the Shinigami killings occur is a very interesting speculation, but impossible to comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Light did not intend to misspell the names, and he also spelled the very first one correct. This means that one of these factors prevented Light from dying, and continuing to utilize the power of the Death Note. Unlocking this secret could have cost Light his life, (if that sounds melodramatic, an early death) but his spelling abilities allowed him to almost rule the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;skit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy handed death note and bored Shinigami encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy: "What's that?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinigami: "It's a Death Note. You just write a person you know's name in it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy: "I can't spell yet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinigami: "That's fine." &lt;em&gt;smirks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The previous skit at the end is based on the assumption that the result of writing a name 4 times consecutively with the intent of being correct will not prevent the death of the Death Note user. However, this is not proven in the series and is merely speciation at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit: The line, "If that sounds melodramatic, an early death" is taken from the light novel "L Change The World," which features an alternative ending that L defeats Light.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In many manga and anime involving modern schools, there is a scene on or at least showing the rooftop of the building. It is a place students can freely go to, often depicted with having a bust-height railing along the edge and the typical 'small building' from which you leave the school building, often also having a ladder to get up (nonetheless being a popular 'hiding' or 'being alone' spot even without one).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask: is this one of many clich&#233;s about Japanese culture that appear throughout the whole media type, or are they a common thing in Japanese schools?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26715">&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, but they look like just a clich&#233;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While many Japanese schools do have flat rooftops, they are usually off-limits and properly locked. So, eating your lunch on the roof or confessing your love at sunset up there... not gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;So I just watched the One Piece Movie - The Battle of Z and it left me wondering who it was that killed Zephyr's crew (while he was in the Navy) and then became a warlord? It says he was a devil fruit user and that is why he acquired that weapon on/as his arm to take out all the devil fruit users he could. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does it get explained anywhere in the manga? Any helpful information would be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8167">&lt;p&gt;The Warlord who killed Zephyr's crew is not named even in the current chapter of the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it was stated that the pirate who killed Zephyr's crew became a warlord during the timeskip. Therefore, there are only three possibilities: &lt;strong&gt;Trafalgar Law&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Buggy&lt;/strong&gt; and the currently &lt;strong&gt;unnamed warlord&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it it also not yet revealed whether the unnamed warlord is a devil fruit user.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="10085">&lt;p&gt;That pirate who killed Zephyr's crew is not Law, Buggy, Doflamingo or any of the current warlords. First, you must consider Zephyr's age. I think it was 20 years ago when the accident happened to his crew; then, that pirate became a warlord. So it's not during the 2-year timeskip. Also, the film Z movie is non-canon, meaning it is just a filler and not related to the real story.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18820">&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty certain it was either Doflamanco, Jimbei, or Crocodile because all the warlords at the time who could have done it would either not have or they wouldn't have used a cutting weapon. Kuma wouldn't have because he was a double agent for Dragon and he is trying to keep his cover. Boa didn't because they would've been turned to stone not murdered. The zombie guy who is dead now would've abducted the dead crew. Mihawk who does use a cutting weapon wouldn't have because he seems to obey orders without much argument. Buggy and trafalgar weren't warlords at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

This was immediately countered by Bluenote saying that &lt;strong&gt;Grandline scientists have already uncovered that the body would only explode if two fruits are eaten by the same user&lt;/strong&gt;.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asuna:&lt;/strong&gt; What?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirito:&lt;/strong&gt; I asked, "You're totally living in this world, aren't you?" Zekken answered with a wordless smile and a charge skill at incredibly speed. That speed was beyond the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asuna:&lt;/strong&gt; "Totally living in this world"? Do you mean they're a really heavy user?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirito:&lt;/strong&gt; No. I wasn't referring to a single VRMMO. I felt like Zekken was a product of the full-dive environment itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asuna:&lt;/strong&gt; What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirito:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't want to give you any preconceived notions. I want you to feel the rest for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Text from Crunchyroll subtitles.) Thus, that she is "totally living in this world" must be the "secret" that Yuuki is referring to; we do not hear of Kirito having any major interactions with Yuuki at any point prior to their duel. Furthermore, Kirito's intuition is correct. Spoilers for the rest of the arc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In episode 22, Kirito states his guess that Yuuki is a Medicuboid user and directs Asuna to the only hospital in Japan using the device.
 We then learn that Yuuki is an AIDS patient. She has been using the Medicuboid machine experimentally to alleviate the suffering caused by her health problems. Beyond providing pain relief and alleviating sensory impairments, the Medicuboid can also immerse the user in a virtual reality environment, such as that of the video games being played in the SAO universe.&lt;/p&gt;

The God(dess) that goes on the wind, with roaring wings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the wiki says the Ragna-mails are described as a mechanized angel. From that perspective, the angels draw their power from the God(dess), as the Convergence Space-time Cannons can only be activated when the song is sung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/crossange/towagatarikaze.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; they refer to it as "the god".&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I haven't watched Anime in many years, but recently I've had time to get back into it. I've seen that one of my favorite series, Fullmetal Alchemist, has done a series reboot.  What I'm wondering is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it present a lot of deep variations&lt;/strong&gt; (plot-wise, character-wise or otherwise)&lt;strong&gt;, or is it just the same series with updated art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="58">&lt;p&gt;Brotherhood is actually more faithful to the Manga. The first &lt;em&gt;'version'&lt;/em&gt; follows the Manga to some extent (about half the show) although it adds some details that do not follow the Manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The whole thing regarding the creation of Homunculus is completely different in the first series.
&lt;br&gt;
 The whole Ishbal incident is also different.
&lt;br&gt;
 The role Hohenheim plays in the first series is rather ridiculous comparing to his &lt;em&gt;'real'&lt;/em&gt; role.
&lt;br&gt;
 And there is also no Father in the first series...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these different aspects I really don't understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the number of episodes: the &lt;em&gt;'reboot'&lt;/em&gt; actually catches up to the first version rather fast (in about the first 4th) and then has &lt;em&gt;'new material'&lt;/em&gt; (comparing to the first one, but actually it is just going according to the manga) until the end of it. Brotherhood also has more episodes (64, compared to 51) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the animation in itself is rather different in Brotherhood (much better IMO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the first series is, in my opinion, rather poor when compared to Brotherhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they both start the same way, the first one starts to develop following a whole different path than the Manga. This is because when it was being aired, the Manga was not done yet, so the plot as well as the end of the anime are invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was done after the Manga ended, so it respects the original Manga much more. I watched both because I didn't know of this distinction. But I can tell you quite objectively, that even if the first one is not so faithful, it was of very good quality, speaking of plot twists, unexpected changes in history and other similar devices.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="60">&lt;p&gt;The new Fullmetal Alchemist series is completely worth it since it adapts the original manga from beginning to end. The previous series, while being really good (in my opinion), diverges from the manga in the whole second half and ends in a way that was not supposed to be. The new series follows everything, retells in just a few chapters what we previously watched and then tells a completely new story with a completely new end.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="256">&lt;p&gt;There are a large number of differences between the two Fullmetal Alchemist anime, with far too many to list; therefore, I'll only cover the major ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the flow of this answer, the following abbreviations will be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMAM = Fullmetal Alchemist (Manga)&lt;br /&gt;
FMA03 = Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 (Anime)&lt;br /&gt;
FMAB = Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (Anime)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the difference is because FMA03 was created when FMAM was still in the early stages of its development. When an anime series is based on a manga that is still in development, the anime is eventually going to reach a point where it outpaces the manga, because anime episodes tend to be developed quicker than manga volumes. When this happens, either filler for the anime is created or changes to the anime's storyline and characters are made so that the anime can continue to be developed. The latter is what happened to FMA03. FMA03's storyline started to diverge from FMAM's storyline after around 10 episodes because, at that point, the anime was starting to outpace the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, FMAB was created when FMAM was nearing the end of its development. This allowed FMAB's storyline to be more faithful to FMAM's storyline because FMAB had a mostly-complete storyline to draw from FMAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major differences between FMA03 and FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storyline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Although both stories follow Edward and Alphonse, the overarching story is considerably different between FMA03 and FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM. In FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM the main antagonist was a character referred to as &lt;strong&gt;Father&lt;/strong&gt;, a being of incredible power who is capable of performing transmutation at will, and without regard for equivalent exchange. His ultimate goal in FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM is to steal the power of what he refers to as "God" and become a being of infinite power and knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The main antagonist in FMA03 is Dante. Unlike Father, she is just a normal human being who created a Philosopher's Stone and has managed to live a long time by transferring her consciousness into the body of other human beings whenever she was nearing death. Dante's only motivation is to become immortal and live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Homunculus&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In FMA03, the &lt;strong&gt;Homunculus&lt;/strong&gt; were the result of attempting to perform human transmutation and failing. They could only be killed by destroying their original body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 In FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM, the Homunculus were created by Father, with each one representing a different aspect of his personality (&lt;strong&gt;Lust&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gluttony&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Envy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Greed&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Wrath&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sloth&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Pride&lt;/strong&gt;; the seven deadly sins). Each Homunculus is also powered by a Philosopher's Stone. Unlike FMA03's Homunculus, FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM's Homunculus do not have an "original" body that needs to be destroyed. Instead, either the Philosopher's Stone powering them needs to be destroyed or its power drained (normally through forcing them to regenerate  multiple times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Another difference is the identify of the Homunculus themselves, with some Homunculus from FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM not appearing in FMA03 at all and others having their name changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Gluttony&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Envy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lust&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Greed&lt;/strong&gt; have the same name and appearance in FMAB, FMAM, and FMA03.&lt;br /&gt;
 FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM's &lt;strong&gt;Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; (King Bradley) is called &lt;strong&gt;Pride&lt;/strong&gt; in FMA03.&lt;br /&gt;
 FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM's &lt;strong&gt;Pride&lt;/strong&gt; (Selim Bradley) is not present in FMA03.&lt;br /&gt;
 FMA03's &lt;strong&gt;Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; is unique to the series. He was the result of Izumi Curtis's attempt to revive her son.&lt;br /&gt;
 FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM's &lt;strong&gt;Sloth&lt;/strong&gt; is not present in FMA03.&lt;br /&gt;
 FMA03's &lt;strong&gt;Sloth&lt;/strong&gt; is unique to the series. She was the result of Ed and Al's attempt to bring back their mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hohenheim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In FMA03, &lt;strong&gt;Hohenheim&lt;/strong&gt; is just a normal human being who was originally Dante's lover; however, he eventually left her due to no longer sharing her desire to have immortality at any cost. Like Dante, he created a Philosopher's Stone and gained a long life by transferring his consciousness into another person's body. His role in the anime is very minor, and he becomes trapped on the other side of the Gate after a confrontation with Dante that ended in failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 In FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM, Hohenheim was a human Philosopher's Stone with a seemingly infinite supply of power. Although he was originally a slave, he was granted his near-immortality by Father well before the events of the series took place. Hohenheim is more significant in FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM, facing off against Father at the end of the series. Unlike FMA03's Hohenheim, he dies at the end of FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM after finally exhausting the power of his Philosopher's Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Gate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;Gate&lt;/strong&gt; is the largest major change in the series. In FMAB &amp;amp; FMAM, the Gate is the source of all alchemy and also seems to be a source of infinite knowledge. The Gate is also guarded by a being commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;, and who is responsible for taking the required tolls from alchemists who perform human transmutation. Those who are capable of performing alchemy have their own gate, and if that gate should be removed (by sacrificing it to Truth), they will no longer be able to perform alchemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 In FMA03, the Gate is still the source of alchemy, but it also serves as a portal between the world of &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Earth&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, the Gate derives its powers from the souls of those who have died on Earth and is what powers the transmutations performed by alchemists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26008">&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few differences, actually. The "original", or the "first one" is an entirely different storyline from the manga. The manga was the original thing, so most people hate the first FMA series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few differences between the two anime series are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Storyline&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In the first FMA, it ends with Ed in London around the time of World War 2. Al gets his body back and stays in "their world", while Ed is stuck in "our world" with his fake right arm and left leg. Al is 10 (the age he was when this chaos happened) again and has no memories of the last four years. But, in Conqueror of Shamballa, he gains his memories when he goes back to "our world" with Ed, after Ed brutally abandons him. Although, in Brotherhood, it sticks to the storyline of the manga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea behind the Homunculi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In the first FMA, the Homunculi were created from failed human transmutations (explaining Sloth's appearance), while, in Brotherhood, the Homunculi were Father's humane "flaws" that he extracted from his personality and put into the "artificial beings". Ironically enough, his wanting to become a god was awfully greedy, even after he'd rid of that "flaw"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Homunculi's appearance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lust has a black dress in the first series, but in Brotherhood, she has a reddish-brown dress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gluttony, Envy, and King Bradley look the same. Sloth looks like Ed and Al's mother, while in Brotherhood, Sloth is a big (much bigger than Armstrong xD) buff male with long black hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first series, King Bradley is Pride, instead of Wrath (in Brotherhood, he's Wrath). In FMA, Wrath is a little boy (Izumi's son) with long black hair and he has Ed's real right arm and left leg. While in Brotherhood, Wrath is King Bradley. In Brotherhood, Pride is King Bradley's son, Selim Bradley. While in the first series, Pride is King Bradley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first series, Greed looks normal, but &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; since Greed takes over Ling Yao's (the twelfth crown prince of Xing) body, Greed looks like Ling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMA&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmEq7.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmEq7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZItdm.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZItdm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The blonde guy in the middle is Father)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who the Homunculi are&lt;/strong&gt; (... meh. It's pretty much explained in the aforementioned point, so I don't think I have to re-explain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hohenheim's appearance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first series, Hohenheim has a more round, smooth face. His glasses are bigger and more round. His hair and beard is a dirty-ish blonde color, and his ponytail is lower. In Brotherhood, Hohenheim has a rectangle-shaped head. His face has more ...umm... say "chiseled" features. His glasses are smaller and not as round. His hair and beard are light blonde, and his ponytail is higher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMA&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I1G1a.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I1G1a.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuhtF.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuhtF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCWLbm.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCWLbm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTuhom.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTuhom.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al's voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose's appearance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first series, Rose's skin is brown. Her hair is dark brown with pink bangs. In Brotherhood, Rose's skin is very white. She has black hair with maroon-ish colored bangs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMA&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/azNqzm.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/azNqzm.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/misT5.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/misT5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose later on&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In the first series, she has a baby (an ugly one, at that. xD ), while, in Brotherhood, she doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a few new characters in Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had more in mind, but in the midst of typing, I forgot what the rest was. I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the absence of the other differences I had planned to provide, I hope this helped.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of research on this topic, but I have found little clues. People say that Obito and Rin are about 4 years older than Kakashi, but I don't think that's true.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People keep saying that it's proven in the manga and the show, but as far as I know that is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29283">&lt;p&gt;That's completely wrong. If they were indeed 4 years older than Kakashi, they should have been a lot taller than him when they were part of Team Minato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's not said exactly how old they are, but judging by the fact that most ninja students become a Genin or get graduated at the age of 12, and since these are the birthdays of the characters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rin is born on November 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obito is born on February 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kakashi is born on September 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are some scenarios we could come up with (imagine the world of Naruto being 2005 and 2006):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three of them are born in the same year, making them all the same age (12) and making their age order like this: Obito&gt;&gt;Kakashi&gt;&gt;Rin, making Obito 7 months older than Kakashi and 9 months older than Rin, while Kakashi being 2 months older than Rin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are born in different years: making it look like if Rin is born in 2005 and the other two in 2006, then it's Rin&gt;&gt;Obito&gt;&gt;Kakashi, making Rin only 13 years old, while Kakashi and Obito are 12, and are 10 months and 3 months younger than Rin, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mean the current timeline, obviously Rin is dead, but Kakashi was 26-27 years old in part 1, and 29-31 years old in part 2, same for Obito. This will automatically make Rin 29-31 years as well, if she was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44904">&lt;p&gt;It makes perfect sense that they're 4 years older than Kakashi. If you become a genin upon graduating the academy and the 3 of them graduated together. That means they're older than Kakashi by atleast 4 years. Kakashi became a genin at 5 while Obito and Rin were 9 meaning they were 4 years older than him when they all graduated the academy. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Why is Rock Lee unable to use ninjutsu or genjutsu?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3311">&lt;p&gt;He simply has &lt;strong&gt;no talent whatsoever for it&lt;/strong&gt;. However, since he decided to be a great ninja nonetheless, he had to excel at Taijutsu.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taijutsu - it was the only bright spot for Lee who was told unequivocally that he had no talent for being a shinobi. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, the &lt;strong&gt;inability to perform both Ninjutsu and Genjutsu would mean that life as a ninja would be impossible&lt;/strong&gt;. But in Lee's case, his closeness to Gai as his Sensei, made him somewhat 'inherit' his hard-working resolve as well as his training habits, which combined (also with Gai interest in Lee) have allowed him to fulfill his dream.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee's case is similar to Naruto's, in that they both achieve greatness through hard-work, rather than natural talent.&lt;br&gt;
Some people are naturally gifted toward some types of technique, like Neji or Sasuke, while others may never have any talent and thus not be fit to become a ninja. Lee's case is the latter, but his &lt;strong&gt;determination was what drove him to not give up&lt;/strong&gt;, becoming an excellent ninja at Taijutsu.&lt;br&gt;
He differs from a regular person, most likely, in sheer will, since (as I've said before) &lt;strong&gt;not every person is fit to be a ninja&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Because they all think that they are the original.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is it valid? Do shadow clones know that they are just clones?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="12872">&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the series, Naruto's Shadow Clones did confuse and fight amongst themselves about who's the original one (before realising that all they had to do was to release the jutsu to figure it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing that as you get more proficient in the technique, both you and the clones begin to recognize who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Naruto's most recent case, the original has Gudoudama behind him, while the clones do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;(naruto shippunden around 250th o something has this concept of shadow clones taking over naruto, more clearly explained there).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="12885">&lt;p&gt;More experienced ninja have shown to have an increased spacial awareness as well as combat awareness. You can see this in various fights throughout the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In the first fight with Uchiha Itachi, Kakashi showed that he was able to create a water clone in a split second designed to take potentially lethal damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the series, clones are used as decoys just as much as they are used to mitigate damage done to the user. Obviously the user in these cases know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; who is the clone and who is the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would make sense then, that young and inexperienced Naruto with a new clone technique (which isn't that much different than other cloning techniques) would not have the experience or spacial awareness to perceive the differences. However a Naruto that has used the technique hundreds if not thousands of times, as well as having participated in numerous fights, would be able to tell right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; he can tell is mostly speculation, but there are several key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when making the clones, he can choose where the clones appear.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One could notice that they were not where they used to be prior to the technique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One could also notice that they have "appeared" as a specific piece within a specific strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consciousness of the clones would see an immediate shift (a pop?) from where he was to where they appear.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could also be extended to immediately recognizing one's self as a clone based on "feeling" the shift from using the technique to the clone appearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One could speculate that the user might even "feel" a shift in the molded chakra from when the user is performing the technique to when the clone appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I got the limited edition of the first volume of the anime, which came with &quot;Asch the Bloody&quot; manga. I figure it's mainly about Ache, but I'm wondering when the story took place relative to the main series. Did it take place during the 6 years he was with Van, or did it occur in the same period as in the anime/game?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="5181" Title="Why is Pride's name different from the word &quot;pride&quot;?" Body="&lt;p&gt;When watching FMA Brotherhood, when van Hohenheim is talking to Pride, he refers to him as &quot;&#12503;&#12521;&#12452;&#12489; (Puraido) when he is talking to him by name, but when he is listing the seven deadly sins, he uses the term &quot;&#20658;&#24930;&quot;, which is pronounced &quot;&#12372;&#12358;&#12414;&#12435;&quot; (gouman). Is there any indication of why the character name is different from the term itself? This is probably true for all seven of the Homunculi, but I only noticed it specifically for Pride.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5183">&lt;p&gt;This is a simple "English is cooler"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As all the homunculi are named with the english seven deadly sins, their names are the hiragana/katagana representation to the english vocalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but when referring to the sin itself the correct translation ("&#20658;&#24930;") is used, as it is not a name (that also has to sound cool), but the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I verified this is true to the other homunculi too, though not for "Father"&lt;/p&gt;

But, the language is tied into the magic system that the device uses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English for &lt;em&gt;Mid-Childa&lt;/em&gt; devices &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German for the &lt;em&gt;Ancient-Belkan&lt;/em&gt; devices &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unison&lt;/em&gt; devices are the devices that merge with their master to increase the combat capabilities, such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Reinforce" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reinforce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Agito" rel="nofollow"&gt;Agito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The devices that are up for the debate are the &lt;em&gt;Modern-Belkan&lt;/em&gt; devices, such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Strada" rel="nofollow"&gt;Strada&lt;/a&gt; (Erio)&lt;/em&gt; using German, while &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Mach_Caliber" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mach Caliber&lt;/a&gt; (Subaru)&lt;/em&gt; uses English. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion would be that &lt;em&gt;Modern-Belkan&lt;/em&gt; devices capable of transforming form would use German (&lt;em&gt;Strada&lt;/em&gt;), while others do not (&lt;em&gt;Mach Caliber&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="7850" Title="Did Kyousuke's parents know about what happened between him and Kirino?" Body="&lt;p&gt;About halfway through the second season, their parents seem to have suspicions on them because suddenly Kyousuke has a close relationship with Kirino.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; And at the end of the second season of &lt;em&gt;Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai&lt;/em&gt;, both of them are finally dating, even if just for a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did their parents know about this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21719">&lt;p&gt;The later parts of Ore Imo contained all sorts of plot holes, dropped plots, and things that were just plain stupid. This was not the anime's fault&amp;mdash;all of its plot holes and stupidity were copied straight from the light novel, but usually without the bloat that plagued the later novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the novels give no clear indication about whether the Kousaka parents knew their children were "dating", but as @nhahtdh says, it seems very unlikely that Kyousuke would be allowed to live in the house if their father knew, since their father is also very protective of Kirino and often critical of Kyousuke. Manami did threaten to tell their parents, but relented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As @noko mentions, there was a scene in both the novels and anime where their mother seemed to be on to something. (This was before they were "dating", though, so it actually was an unfounded accusation at that point.) This occurred in Chapter 1 of Volume 10 of the light novels. However, if we look at the conversation, it doesn't seem like she actually thought they were romantically involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then Mom started with a topic that made me yell in surprise -----&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"&#8230;Kyousuke, you&#8230;have you done something strange to Kirino?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Pfffff."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Ha? Ha!?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Hearing that totally unexpected topic, both Kirino and I were caught
  off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Mom? What did you just say?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"I asked if you have done something strange to Kirino."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"What do you mean by 'strange'?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Yes! Strange means strange things!!"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Give me a good answer! You really are Kirino's mother!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"That&#8230;in other words&#8230;You are thinking that I have done some erotic
  things to Kirino?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Cough cough cough!"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Next to me, Kirino choked.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Well&#8230;her reaction is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Seeing my reaction, Mom's eyes suddenly became sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"I didn't mean it like that, but since that&#8217;s the first thing that
  came to your mind, so it seems&#8230;.."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All their mother does is ask if Kyousuke has done something strange to Kirino. Kyousuke himself brings up "erotic things", and their mother jumps on the fact that that was the first meaning he thought of for "something strange." She does go on to mention all the lovey-dovey things they've been doing recently, including coming home in wedding clothes, but until Kyousuke opened his big dumb mouth, she probably just wondered why they were suddenly so close and engaging in such strange behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, their father already knows about Kirino's otaku hobbies and how Kyousuke is in on it and covering for her. The novels remind us of that in this piece of dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dad made a 'don't pass the ball to me now' expression then sighed and
  said:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"I'm not worried about the situation that your mother just talked
  about. I'm the one who understands what is going on between you and
  Kirino better than anyone. For you to cherish each other so much is
  within my expectations."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dad, you are making it worse!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;My face was gradually getting redder, my throat seemed like it was
  blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"&#8230;&#8230;"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;No, no, don't say something so embarrassing! I'm embarrassed!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&#8230;.I didn't even know why Dad spoke so highly of me ----- no, it&#8217;s
  probably because I was the one who brought Kirino back from America.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It's natural for a doting elder brother to take care of his little
  sister.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Now, I could say it without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Still, Dad wasn't the type to just praise someone that easily.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Kyousuke. Think back to about a year ago."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"A year ago?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Yes, about Kirino's - no, your hobby, we talked about it before."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"&#8230;.."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Kirino's hobby &#8211; you mean the 'little sister based eroge'? When you
  caught her?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;At that time, I insisted that it was my hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably enough to explain their newly found closeness for their father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the novel, in Chapter 4 of Volume 10, Kyousuke asks his mother about her suspicions, and his mother replies that she never really believed they were romantically involved, reinforcing what I claimed above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Oh right, Mom. I got an A. So was your inexplicable misunderstanding
  solved?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"What inexplicable misunderstanding are you talking about?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"That &#8212; the misunderstanding that I had a love affair with Kirino."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Even now, I still don't understand. Mom suspected that I had an impure
  relationship with Kirino, so she forced me to keep a distance with
  Kirino. But why did she allow me to come back if I got an A? It had no
  effect on my relationship with Kirino at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Ah, you meant that."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Mom burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Actually, I never thought that you had done anything to your little
  sister."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"&#8212; What?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Did I just hear something unbelievable? I thought about what I just
  heard &#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"What! What is going on!?"&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I roared and stood up.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;"Recently, your relationship with Kirino has improved. So under these
  conditions, I separated you two. By doing that, you &#8211; the lazy brother
  would do your best due to the power of your siscon nature. Looks like
  my plan worked out in the end."&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Mom continued praising herself, "I'm so smart."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The later novels don't ever suggest that their parents know anything, and it seems likely they don't. After all, as far as we can gather, not much changed in their relationship, at least externally. Maybe they're a little more lovey-dovey, but they were already pretty lovey-dovey by Volume 10. They were already going to each others' rooms at night and going out together on weekends; the only real difference is that the weekend outings are "dates" now. They do go around telling their friends that they're dating, but aside from Manami, none of their friends has any reason to rat them out, and Manami gave in, so it's probably just a sort of open secret among their circle of friends. Also, they only "dated" for around three months, and were probably rather scrupulous about keeping the secret during this period&amp;mdash;no more coming home together in wedding clothes. So, all in all, it seems that the Kousaka parents didn't know anything.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="50908" Title="Why is alchemy powered by tectonic plates?" Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;In the manga, alchemy is said to have been taught to Amestrians over 350 years prior to the start of the series by a mysterious man known as The Philosopher from the East and is explained to harness the diastrophic energy that is released from the movement and collision of tectonic plates deep within the Earth's crust to power transmutation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am simply confused between the correlation of tectonic plates and alchemy's power. How does the tectonic plates moving act as the fuel for any non-p.stone transmutations??? Alkahestry's source of power being &quot;chi&quot;, or the lifeforce of the earth itself makes perfect sense; so why is alchemy powered by the movement of tectonic plates? That's so random to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50912">&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the most explanation we &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; get is this one panel in chapter 67:
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WAHPD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WAHPD.png" alt="Panel about earth energy as trasmutation energy source."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're wondering how this manages to do transmutations other than earth based ones, remember, the earth isn't the source of the transmutation itself, just the &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; used in it. Just the necessary materials (the equivalent exchange) aren't enough to perform a transmutation. You also need the knowlede of how to rearrange the material to its new form (which is why alchemy isn't more widely used) and the energy to actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; the rearranging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amestris' alchemy uses the energy in the ground (previously caused by plate tectonics, currently by... Well, let's not spoil it), while earter alkahestry uses natural chi flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;br&gt;
Never explaned beyond that one panel, since it's not really important to the story.&lt;br&gt;
Cool action and existential philosophy are.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="43671" Title="Inter-Clan Marriage?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Although it's never a rule, it seems the standard throughout Naruto that Ninjas married within their own clan so as to preserve their Kekkei Genkai (Hyuuga) or just to preserve the blood lines (Uzumaki). (This can still be broken as is the case between Minato and Kushina.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems though, that in the final chapter, all the Ninja of the 'Konoha 11' seem to marry outside of their clan, like Naruto and Hinata (Uzumaki and Hyuuga) or Shikamaru and Temari (Nara and Sand). I understand that this was more of a fan service chapter, but is there any in-universe explanation as to why none of the Ninja of Naruto's generation decided to marry in-clan?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44241">&lt;p&gt;It is true that shinobi clans married within their respective clan so that their Kekkei Genkai would remain in the family. But it was around the time when all the nations were at war with each other. Once Hashirama Senju decided to distribute all the tailed beasts among the hidden villages, the majority of attention (of bad people) shifted from obtaining bloodline limit techniques to obtaining/controlling tailed beasts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in case of interclan marriages, it was not sure that the offspring would awaken his/her Bloodline Limit. It was evident in the case of Tsunade's parents who were half Senju and half Uzumaki because very little is known about them, but it was certain that they were no shinobi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of not having interclan marriages was high when nations were at war and having a technique unique to only one family/clan meant that their country would have an advantage over the enemy. Like in the case of Kimimaro's Clan. But since it was evident that every offspring couldn't awaken their bloodline limit, interclan marriages were often held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Uchiha, there was never any protocol to marry within Uchiha. Because their Kekkai Genkai was not easy to awaken, even for those who were descendants of great Uchiha shinobi. Even if someone from outside their clan awakened the Sharingan, it would do a great deal of damage to one's body and eventually lead to death (as in Kakashi's case where he was paralyzed for an entire week after using his Mangeky Sharingan to save Gaara. Luckily by the end of Kaguya's Arc Obito helped him control his Sharingan but it drained out his stamina quickly).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="46831">&lt;p&gt;The idea of the post-War wake was a definitive change in mindset among all Ninja. What was once taboo was finally available at no negative cost to the individual. Therefore, when the surviving clan members mate it is only natural that they would all utilize their newfound freedoms as opposed to sticking to the harsh, restricting rules of the past. Its all symbolic of the change Naruto set into motion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dragon Ball Wikia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The plot framework and character designs were created by original author Akira Toriyama. The series will be developed by Toei, in a similar process to the Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT animes. The beginning of the series plot takes place after the Majin Buu Saga, potentially putting it in either the 10 year gap towards the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament, or afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dragon Ball Super is set to begin airing in Japan on Fuji TV, July 5th, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new anime series Dragon Ball Super is going to be aired from July 2015 onwards. It's story will pick up after the events of Resurrection 'F'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the story of Dragon Ball Z has taken a significant turn by introducing the Super Saiyan God ability and other plot events, the fate of Dragon Ball GT is left hanging in the balance. At this minute, there is no official word about whether it will still exist in the continuity of the Dragon Ball Universe or not.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="38455" Title="Why do characters in One Piece have weird signature suffixes to their lines?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I have seen often that characters in One Piece have their weird (read: at times irritating) signatures. Is there any specific reason for them?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the picture below, Vito has &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;rorero&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as his signature. These suffixes sometimes kill the entire feel of the scene, which is why I was wondering why were they so important to have in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXK7B.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXK7B.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38475">&lt;p&gt;I could ask you a similar question. Why do so many characters in One Piece have weird laughter styles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's because it's a characteristic of the series. Characters laugh in specific ways (gabababa, dereshishishi, horohorohoeo etc), as well as have certain catchphrases that they repeat, like the zipper-mouth guy of CP9 - Fukuro, as well as many other characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's just how the universe of One Piece operates. You shouldn't question this if you want to keep your sanity intact.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38610">&lt;p&gt;In One Piece, many characters are known to laugh in unusual ways by either adding to the typical "haha" or using different syllables entirely. These laughter patterns are often unique to individuals and may be based on their personalities or appearances. Some of the especially weird laughs are different in translated versions; for example, Caesar's "shurororo" becomes "shuhohoho" in the English manga. It should be noted that laughing style of "Fufufufu" or "Ufufufufu" is a common Japanese laughing style used for mature women in anime and manga. In addition, the common phrase "Arara" is not a laugh, but rather the Japanese version of "Oh my, oh my, oh my". &lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="39114">&lt;p&gt;One Piece does quite a bit across the long franchise to ensure that every plot character is remembered in a different way. In addition to being drawn differently having different suffixes or having a different laugh serves as a tool to help establish that character as a unique identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caesar, Doflamingo,Gekko Moria and numerous others in the show, the manga and the movies all make use of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to suffixes and laughs there is also gestures, like Brook asking to see your panties or chopper hiding the wrong way that are also unique to add differentiation to each character. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summation, the above are all tropes commonly used in anime to add individuality to each character. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="849" Title="Where do Saga's pants come from?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 71, Saga wears his Gemini Golden Cloth when he was fully naked. But in episode 73, when his cloth shatters, we see that he is wearing a pair of pants. When did he put on those pants? Where did they come from? Were they hidden inside the Golden Cloth?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6vHm.png&quot; alt=&quot;his body is entirely naked&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10;&lt;em&gt;Just before he wears his cloth.

(Episode 73)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3226">&lt;p&gt;After rewatching this a couple times, I believe this is just a case of censoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Cloth is put on to begin with, there is really no way there could be a single, contiguous (cyan) fabric encased within it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIucX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIucX.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the Cloth itself is made up of multiple pieces, so it's more than likely the pants did not come from the Cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we discount the option of him, somehow, off-camera, removing the armor and placing the pants beneath, the only option is that it was added as a censor; as @user301 noted in a comment above, the lighting when the Cloth shattered did not permit a shadow in Saga's groin area (nor did the subsequent shots allow blocking it); so, in order to not have to do a black box or pixelation, the production staff opted to use a concept similar to &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Magic Pants&lt;/a&gt;, permitting Saga to have a pair of pants remaining after the Cloth itself shattered.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4731">&lt;p&gt;In the Anime, strange effects happen with clothing when wearing the Cloth (and later removing it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At many points of the series, you can see that when Seiya wears the Cloth, his pants are changed from his trademark jeans to another kind of elastic fabric. When he takes off his Cloth, or when it is destroyed, this fabric is kept instead of returning to jeans. I recalling this effect was evident also with Shun, but happens to every Saint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare it to a magical girl transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say that the manga do not incur on this. When Seiya wears Saggitarius Cloth for the first time, you can see the star patterned-pyjama under it.&lt;/p&gt;

The writer for episode 6 is apparently still TBA. However, I can't find what source they're citing for this information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has previously been involved with Dragon Ball Super, having written the script for 22 episodes, according to &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=1623" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Anime News Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; Rem liked Misa so much, or maybe he was in love with her. He wrote L's name in the Death Note and killed L because he was protecting Misa and he knew he will die soon after doing so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I just wonder: why didn't he instead tell L's real name to Light Yagami or Misa, so they could write L's name in their Death Note and kill him themselves? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="55318">&lt;p&gt;One of the Shinigami rules (shown during scene breaks and not the actual story) says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Shinigami must not tell humans the names or life spans of individuals he sees. This is to avoid confusion in the human world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another rule states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a Shinigami decides to use a Death Note to end the life of the killer of an individual it favors, that individual's life will be extended but the Shinigami will die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no specific consequence stated for breaking the first rule, one might also assume that it would result in similar punishment. In the end Rem probably decided to write the name herself due to the urgency of the situation. (And for dramatic purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;

Leo's power is based on the myth of the Nemean Lion, a beast who was completely impenetrable to blades. This protection was grated to Izayoi and blessed him with the same defense against blades, thus making it possible for Izayoi to safely catch the Spear of Indra and throw it back. In Last Embryo 1, the Minotaur attacked Izayoi with Proto Keravnos but he was completely unharmed despite that a single strike from Proto Keravnos can surpass the concept of &quot;slash&quot;. However, this Sun Authority is not effective against Gifts which could break the Gifts of stars or slay the Celestial Spirits, as seen in volume 12 when Laius successfully slashed Izayoi by his Harpe, though Izayoi weakened his attack and only received a small injury.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who gave him the sun authority and when did it happen?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="22629" Title="What was inside Yuuko's wallet?"

&lt;p&gt;The wallet is Yuuko's because she identified it by the color and unique contents (the snakeskin). The empty face is one of shock and perhaps angst because all her money is gone. The gag here is not the contents but her reaction after looking in her wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

I apologise for not mentioning the episode number.

&lt;p&gt;The episode that you are looking for is &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter/episode-112-monster-x-and-x-monster-646069" rel="nofollow"&gt;Monster x And x Monster&lt;/a&gt; (ep. 112). The slow motion part is largely the first half of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tracks that play during the slow motion scenes. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_3rJhzHvq5GJ_FATfhk4_lUNIs9zBuxR" rel="nofollow"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; a playlist of tracks from the Chimera Ant arc (30 tracks), of which I think your best bets are either &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDTGFaC9SZA&amp;amp;index=30&amp;amp;list=PL_3rJhzHvq5GJ_FATfhk4_lUNIs9zBuxR" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hegemony of the Food Chain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q43wzP6A1CM&amp;amp;index=29&amp;amp;list=PL_3rJhzHvq5GJ_FATfhk4_lUNIs9zBuxR" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kingdom of Predators&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYS1PjTkHIQ&amp;amp;index=14&amp;amp;list=PL_3rJhzHvq5GJ_FATfhk4_lUNIs9zBuxR" rel="nofollow"&gt;Legend of the Martial Artist&lt;/a&gt;. Of the three, I think Legend of the Martial Artist is the song you are referring to, but you can go through the playlist to find the specific song for which you are looking. Keep in mind that multiple tracks were playing during the time you are referring, so it might be a mix of a few different songs in that playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

But it doesn't necessarily mean that the show is a 2000-2003 production.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is a dark, brooding place populated by humans, but ruled in reality by powerful beings known as the Darkstalkers, and there is constant conflict between them as they try to determine who is the most powerful of them all. Zombies, vampires, werewolves - all of them compete in contests of strength and sheer will to attain their own personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;All of this becomes moot when a race of Aztec robots called the Huitzil decide that humanity isn't worth saving, and start waging war on the world, while in the sky, a solar god from outer space plots the conquest of Earth. And the Darkstalkers must become unwilling allies in order to save the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun totem spits out Pyron, the boss of the series, who challenges every monster character and wins all battles until his defeat in the end. The background of the anime is pretty dark most of the time, as you can see in this screenshot of the sun totem:&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="35777" Title="Could Hidan possibly get out of his hole?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm just wondering, in the episode where Hidan lost his head against the Konoha jounin, which he killed eventually (forgot the name). There is a scene where he lost his head, and his body is still moving, looking for the head. Until Kakuzu stitched Hidan's head to his body. Then in the scene where Shikamaru buried him, Hidan is literally disconnected with his body (or did some of his parts even get vaporized?) But his head is still working. Supposing his body parts could still move on its own regardless if they are not connected with a central nervous system, could Hidan &quot;chew&quot;, &quot;claw&quot;, &quot;divide&quot; his way out of the hole? and then from some bit make himself whole again? His becoming whole again would incur maybe centuries, lets just say that somehow his tissues would become whole again over time. The topic would be, if he could get out of the mound which Shikamaru created from him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35780">&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for Hidan to crawl out of his hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His body was destroyed. When he was captured by Shikamaru, his body was exploded using exploding tags, leaving only his head. So, having his body digging the hole would be impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Hidan is immortal, he doesn't seems to possess healing ability. This is proofed by the fact that he needs Kakuzu to stitch his head back to his body. He can't do this himself by means of regeneration. So, it'd be impossible for him to regenerate his already lost body and have it dig for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was buried several meters underground. It wasn't said how many meters but from the image shown in the manga and the anime, I'd say it is about 3 meters or more with the diameter approximately 1 meter. So using the formula for tube volume, pi x r x r x h, we get 3.14 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 3, which is 2.356 meter cubic of soil. &lt;a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/earth-soil-weight-d_1349.html"&gt;1 meter cubic of soil is about 1,200 kg&lt;/a&gt;, so that means he have 2,827.433 kg of soil weighing his head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digging from inside is an impossible task. When digging from outside, you move the mass from one place to another. However, since his head is surrounded by soil, suppose that he use his mouth to try digging, he would not have place to put the soil away, not to mention that when he do so, the soil above would fall down. His option would be to swallow it, but I doubt he would be able to swallow 2,800 kg of soil and then using his mouth to climb out of the hole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidan is buried in a forest belonging to the Nara clan. Suppose that somehow he managed to climb his way up, as implied by Shikamaru when he buried Hidan, the deer in that forest would contact the Nara clan and someone would send his head back into the hole and bury him again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He can't wait for centuries. Naruto Second Fanbook stated that while Hidan is indeed still alive, he is dying from malnutrition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="31330" Title="Why did Obito spare Kakashi?" Body="&lt;p&gt;During his time of Obito being with Madara, the White Zetsus told him that Rin and &quot;Stupid Kakashi&quot; were in trouble. Obito hurried as fast as he could to get to where Kakashi and Rin where. Once he got there, he saw that Rin was already dead and that Kakashi was the one who killed her. At the same time, Kakashi and Obito awakened the Mangekyou Sharingan which made Kakashi faint and Obito just sad/mad. Obito got so mad he went on a rampage. He killed all the other people that were around Kakashi and Rin. Once he finished, he went to Rin and hugged her. After that, he looked back to see Kakashi who was on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At that time, Obito had a huge chance of killing Kakashi, but for some reason, he did not want to kill the person who took the love of his life away from him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Obito spare Kakashi? Why didn't he kill him instead? Did he just feel bad for killing someone who was defenseless, or because he was going to feel bad for killing his old friend? Is there another reason for this, or is there just none? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31356">&lt;p&gt;For Obito, Kakashi was a victim just as Rin was. He didn't blame Kakashi for killing Rin but rather for "letting her die" and not being able to keep his promise. He was aware of the fact Rin had the 3-Tails inside her and chose to die by Kakashi's hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, he never resented Kakashi himself but rather the world that created this situation and forced Rin to commit suicide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 600 of &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt;, Kakashi asks Obito if he blames him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kakashi: Aren't you going to blame me?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Obito: With this insignificant reality, what good will blaming you do?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Obito: I hold no interest in the affairs of this world that's about to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ydLnzl.png" alt="Naruto ch. 600, Obito answered Kakashi&amp;#39;s question"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47416">&lt;p&gt;A lot of people don't know why Obito didn't choose to kill Kakashi when he had the chance. Obito chose not to kill Kakashi because they had been lifelong friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, Obito knew about Rin having the three tails placed in her, and he couldn't bring himself to doing it. When Kakashi "killed" Rin, Obito and Kakashi developed their Mangekyou Sharingan. As Kakashi fainted on the ground because of it, Obito got mad and killed all of the mist ninjas around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe he didn't kill Kakashi because he knew he was defenseless.&lt;/p&gt;

Same editor/writer? What common points link those two anime close enough to  have an entire episode of &lt;em&gt;Luluco&lt;/em&gt; dedicated to &lt;em&gt;Kill La Kill&lt;/em&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36124">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My question is: what links those two shows? Same editor/writer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same everything, pretty much. Both shows are original IPs by &lt;a href="http://www.st-trigger.co.jp/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Trigger&lt;/a&gt; (the animation studio), directed by studio founder Imaishi Hiroyuki, and I assume that many other staff members worked on both shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trigger (or maybe it's just Imaishi) is known to be fond of reference humor - there were, for example, oblique references to &lt;em&gt;Kill la Kill&lt;/em&gt; even in &lt;em&gt;Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de&lt;/em&gt;, the latter of which was an adaptation of a non-Trigger IP. Given the opportunity to reference one of their own IPs from another of their own IPs - which means they don't have to tiptoe around copyright issues - the results are what you see in episode 7 of &lt;em&gt;Space Patrol Luluco&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;em&gt;Kill la Kill&lt;/em&gt; thing in episode 7, there's also &lt;em&gt;Little Witch Academia&lt;/em&gt; in episode 8; &lt;em&gt;Sex &amp;amp; Violence with Machspeed&lt;/em&gt; in episode 9; and &lt;em&gt;Inferno Cop&lt;/em&gt; in episode 11. These three things are also original Trigger IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="69" Title="What differentiates anime from regular cartoons?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In my region, people don't know the difference between anime and regular cartoons. When they see me watching anime, or they hear about it somehow, they say that I'm watching a regular cartoon and hence I'm being childish. Sometimes, they even display sarcastic attitudes, so that giving a serious long explanation wouldn't be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What effectively explains how an anime is different from a regular cartoon?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="72">&lt;p&gt;My personal argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cartoons are &lt;em&gt;mainly&lt;/em&gt; produced for &lt;em&gt;kids&lt;/em&gt;, with topics about friendship, fun, exploration and similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anime / manga and related media &lt;em&gt;mainly&lt;/em&gt; are produced for targets of &lt;em&gt;all ages&lt;/em&gt; (except for Hentai and Ecchi series, of course). They can of course contain the "kids content", but there are much more serious ones out there, e.g. ones about love, death, conflicts, and wars. They're simply much deeper. The drawing and character art of cartoons is often vastly deformed / otherworldly to emphasize the disconnect from reality and the fun part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difference is the way characters evolve. In most comics I've read, you have episodic experiences which are, at most, loosely connected, and so characters don't really evolve / grow up. I'm sure there are counter-examples out there, but I think we can agree that the characters are not the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most anime and related media, the characters are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; deeper. Of course you also have the occasional counter-example here, but the characters get a much bigger focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of anime / manga / visual novels / light novels as (Western) books / series / movies with regards to the content, except they're drawn (or have illustrative content) instead of being filmed / purely in written form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there are examples of anime that look and feel just like Western cartoons (Panty &amp;amp; Stocking with Garterbelt, for the "look" aspect, at least) and the other way around (Avatar - The Last Airbender, Korra).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="73">&lt;p&gt;Anime and cartoon are both used to identified an animated production, the first made in Japan, the other ones in the rest of the world...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have to show more detailed difference I'd say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anime: Distinct facial expressions. Wide variation in physical characteristics. 
Physical features of characters are, on the whole, closer to reality than cartoons.&lt;br&gt;
Cartoon: Characters usually have features that are not relative to the rest of the body and therefore further from reality than anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics/Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anime: concentrates mostly on life issues or things tied closer to human emotion.&lt;br&gt;
Cartoons: are generally made to make people laugh and so is more comical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition and Term:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anime: English dictionaries define the word as &#8216;Japanese style of motion picture animation&#8217;.&lt;br&gt;
Cartoon: was used as a model or study for a painting but is now associated with caricatures for humor and satire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Anime_vs_Cartoon"&gt;Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="74">&lt;p&gt;We all know Anime is "Japanese-style cartoons", and this often makes people say they are both cartoons. Yes they are, but this doesn't mean &lt;em&gt;there aren't differences&lt;/em&gt;. Substantial differences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the &lt;strong&gt;audience&lt;/strong&gt;. The main &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; difference is that Anime are not cartoons for kids, usually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Anime get censored when dubbed in foreign countries and they are rendered as quite childish (and this is sometimes really annoying), while the original holds some adult references, scenes containing violence and so on. While this is not true for all Anime, as some are really aimed to children, some of them need a mature audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;strong&gt;characters&lt;/strong&gt; are treated quite differently. There is more growth in Anime characters as it develops for a whole series. For example, &lt;em&gt;Zabuza&lt;/em&gt; in Naruto ends up being quite a likeable character because you go beyond him simply being an antagonist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Anime and cartoons treat &lt;strong&gt;themes&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;em&gt;life, death, religion, love, betrayal, ethics, etc&lt;/em&gt;. But cartoons really treat such matters quite differently. Just think about Disney-style cartoons: do they share anything with Anime in terms of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they treat these topics?&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="75">&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty difficult question, but I may have some tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;cartoons&lt;/em&gt; are meant to be watched by &lt;em&gt;kids&lt;/em&gt;, anime is meant to be watched by &lt;em&gt;all ages&lt;/em&gt;:  there is a series for everyone, for every theme, for every age. From little kids, like Doraemon, for young kids like Pokemon, to teenagers like shonen series or teen-shojos, to more adult like seinens or even hentai. Everyone can enjoy something.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="81">&lt;p&gt;No matter how you look at it, an anime is a cartoon. The main difference is that an anime is considered a Japanese style of cartoons in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many English-language dictionaries &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anime"&gt;define&lt;/a&gt; anime as "a Japanese style of motion-picture animation" or as "a style of animation developed in Japan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in Japan, the term "anime" does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style. Instead, it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of animation from around the world (both foreign and domestic). The word "anime" is loan word referring to "animation" or "cartoons," adapted from the English word "animation."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this from another perspective, in Japan, Disney movies are referred to as "Disney Anime", This refers to a certain style, not the genre as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese Wikipedia on "anime" &lt;a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1#anime"&gt;specifically notes&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#12450;&#12491;&#12513;&#12540;&#12471;&#12519;&#12531;&#12434;&#12450;&#12491;&#12513;&#12392;&#30053;&#12379;&#12427;&#35328;&#35486;&#12399;&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;&#12395;&#38480;&#12425;&#12428;&#12427;&#12383;&#12417;&#12289;&#26085;&#26412;&#22269;&#22806;&#12391;&#12300;anime&#12301;&#12392;&#12356;&#12358;&#22580;&#21512;&#12399;&#26085;&#26412;&#35069;&#12398;&#34920;&#29694;&#27096;&#24335;&#12398;&#12450;&#12491;&#12513;&#12395;&#23550;&#12375;&#12390;&#29992;&#12356;&#12425;&#12428;&#12427;&#12290;&#26085;&#26412;&#22269;&#20869;&#12391;&#12399;&#12289;&#35069;&#20316;&#22269;&#12420;&#20316;&#39080;&#12395;&#38306;&#12431;&#12426;&#12394;&#12367;&#12450;&#12491;&#12513;&#12364;&#20351;&#29992;&#12373;&#12428;&#12427;&#12290;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Japanese, "animation" was abbreviated to "anime," Outside of Japan, the word has been used only to refer to media considered "Japanese animation." However in Japan, the country of origin and literary style (of the media) are not taken into account when applying "anime" to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western cartoons and anime can both vary in drawing styles, based on the staff, budget, and character/set designs. Anime series are typically more detailed than your average western show as there is more of an abundance of technically skilled artists overseas than there are available in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both can reach different age regardless of their initial target audience (&lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;My Little Pony&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; are notable examples). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically western cartoons are more lighthearted when compared to Japanese anime. However, both can deal with more mature themes, in both a serious (like &lt;em&gt;Cyber 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mighty Max&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt;) and humorous light (like &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Family Guy&lt;/em&gt;). There are western cartoons for mature adults just like there are 18+ anime in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask the average person in your country and one in Japan, both will consider them to be childish. The difference between anime and cartoons is very subjective. It typically comes down to what you like and how you like it. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="101">&lt;p&gt;The difference is only subjective, depending on yours and your peers' perceptions. Keep in mind that MOST of the anime that is exported from Japan is actually aimed at children. (defining 'children' as extending through the teenage years)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When they see me watching anime, or they hear about it somehow, they say that I'm watching a cartoon and hence I'm being childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney didn't think &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_%28film%29"&gt;Fantasia&lt;/a&gt; was for children either. Having watched the film several times, I'm inclined to agree. The point is that although they have tended in that direction (with a few notable exceptions) in the western world, there is no particular reason to limit cartoon themes to kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes, they even display sarcastic attitudes, so that giving a serious long explanation wouldn't be possible.&lt;/strong&gt; What are the effective ways to explain that anime is different from cartoons in these kind of situations? Are there any clever sentences that will make an impact on people who don't know about anime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize you only included this for context... but if someone is being sarcastic, it's not as if any real answer is applicable. This section of the question is also probably offtopic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest method of convincing someone would probably be making them sit through a showing of Grave of the Fireflies... although that's not particularly quick or clever.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="109">&lt;p&gt;This question is really usual, especially when you are an anime fan. In my situation, I don't want 'anime' to be called 'cartoons' because they are so different for me. The following are the differences I think they have: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anime targets a vast audience, from kids to adults, while cartoons&lt;br&gt;
mainly targets kids, with the exception of course of adults who
likes to watch cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anime tackles themes for kids, teens and adults and have stories that
have depth, while cartoons       tackles more themes that are for
kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anime came from Japanese productions, and cartoons came from US
productions (or anywhere except Japan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can really tell if what you are watching is an anime or a
cartoons by it's visual graphics (if you're an anime fan then, you'll
know what I mean). You can notice that the characters from one
cartoon show is very different from how cartoon characters in another
cartoon show looks like. However in anime, you can notice some
similarities on how they look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best way for you to explain is to let them watch a very good anime and have them watch some cartoons, then tell them, "Saw the difference?". Or just let them think what they want. I experienced what you experience a lot from my parents but I just let them say what they want or think what they think. Respectfully ignore them. Just make sure that you don't disrespect them as you try to defend anime and that watching anime doesn't affect your attitude negatively. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="406">&lt;p&gt;I don't want to get too subjective here, but there are some key aspects that I discuss with others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art style; there is a distinct difference in how characters in an Anime series are drawn as opposed to Western style series.  (Occasionally, you'll get a shout-out to the Anime style, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target audience; there are a wide variety of audiences and an even more diverse demographic of consumers of anime than there are of traditional Western cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theming; as much of a culture shock as it may be (which I'll get to in a moment), many Anime have themes that wouldn't make much sense in the Western world, such as 108 for the Buddist number of temptations man will case, 4 for death, white for death, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture differences; there are &lt;em&gt;quite a few series&lt;/em&gt; that are tolerated, if not acceptable, in Japan, whereas in the Western world, they'd be censored in some way or not permitted at all, or merit whomever is a fan of it some very dirty looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things that would cause controversy or be seen as "unacceptable" in Western animation would be homosexual relationships (yaoi/yuri), large age gap relationships, lolicon/shotacon (which is strangely &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; but heavily frowned upon), and incest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western animation wouldn't touch &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; with a one-hundred foot pole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22540">&lt;p&gt;Firstly, anime in English tends to refer to Japanese content. However, as noted in &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/81/2604"&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;, "anime" in Japanese just refers to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; animated content. That said, it's fine to have this discrepancy &amp;mdash; similar things have cropped up in other English loanwords. (For instance "Lied" or its plural "Lieder" refer to 19th to 20th century styled German language art songs when the words are used &lt;em&gt;in English&lt;/em&gt;, but in German, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lied#History" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;"Lieder"&lt;/a&gt; seems to sometimes take on a more general sense.) &lt;strong&gt;So in this sense, at the very least, &lt;em&gt;in English&lt;/em&gt;, not all cartoons are anime, because not all cartoons are Japanese.&lt;/strong&gt; (Certainly it would be ridiculous for me to go around claiming that &lt;em&gt;Spongebob Squarepants&lt;/em&gt; is anime to an English speaker.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear whether "anime" is simply a subset of "cartoons". The main problem, which other answers have touched on, appears to be that in English, "cartoon" often suggests something intended for young children, which does not cover the content of a lot of anime. Certainly things like &lt;em&gt;Serial Experiments Lain&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;Fate&lt;/em&gt; series are, by this connotation, not really "cartoons".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even shows animated outside of Japan are sometimes denoted as "cartoons", even when their content or art style doesn't really fall into the areas of the average person's idea of a "cartoon". For instance, a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=waltz%20with%20bashir%20cartoon&amp;amp;oq=waltz%20with%20bashir%20cartoon&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3027j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=93&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=waltz%20with%20bashir%20%22cartoon%22" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;waltz with bashir "cartoon"&lt;/code&gt; suggests that at least a few writers in large newspapers (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/movies/26bash.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/war-death-and-animation-cartoon-film-stirs-israels-conscience-1021732.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) described the animated film &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz_with_Bashir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waltz with Bashir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a cartoon, and both its subject matter (the 1982 Lebanon War) and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=663&amp;amp;q=waltz%20with%20bashir&amp;amp;oq=waltz%20with&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l10.112.1774.0.2505.10.8.0.2.2.0.116.635.7j1.8.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.10.654.qmuUDfV8Fy8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;its style&lt;/a&gt; hardly resemble the likes of the average cartoon, both in content and style. (Compare to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arthur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=archer&amp;amp;oq=archer&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.839j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=93&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=archer%20%22cartoon%22" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is, at least in the English-speaking world, markedly more famous than &lt;em&gt;Waltz with Bashir&lt;/em&gt;. I have not seen &lt;em&gt;Archer&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it is hardly more appropriate for children than &lt;em&gt;Waltz with Bashir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So insofar as usage &lt;em&gt;in English&lt;/em&gt; goes, either:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anime &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different from "regular cartoons", but &lt;em&gt;only insofar as "regular cartoons" consists of children's shows&lt;/em&gt; and also fail to cover other animated content like &lt;em&gt;Waltz with Bashir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Anything outside of regular cartoon-appropriate content is best either described with a different classification if this gives more information about the content (e.g. "anime") or a broader one (e.g. "animated content").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anime &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; different from "regular cartoons", because "cartoon" covers anything at all animated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either sense, "anime" is really only about the fact that something was animated (and marketed towards the Japanese).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am inclined to prefer the first view in terms of how I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; use the word "cartoon" (so describe &lt;em&gt;Doraemon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_Maruko-chan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chibi Maruko-chan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;Fate/zero&lt;/em&gt; as "cartoons") because of the connotations of "cartoon". However, I would consider the second to still be acceptable (in the sense that I won't get upset about that view being taken) because it's obvious that people also use "cartoon" similarly "inappropriately" on other more adult-oriented shows that &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="27366" Title="How can I easily find all languages a show has been dubbed into?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I usually only watch anime with the original Japanese voice actors, since I've had bad experiences with dubs in the past. However, I'm sometimes interested in watching a show dubbed in something that isn't Japanese, and moreover, I want to know if there are any alternatives to English dubs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there any site that will let me see &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; languages a show has been dubbed into efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyAnimeList gives the voice actors in various languages for characters. However, this information is often incomplete. For instance, I just looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123839/http://myanimelist.net/character/5449/Nagisa_Misumi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the page for Nagisa Misumi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Pretty Cure&lt;/em&gt; and noticed that no Cantonese voice actress is listed, even though a Cantonese dub exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Wikipedia article in some language &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; for a show will sometimes list any voice actors for the dub in &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; in addition to the Japanese voice actors. Information about dubs in other languages is generally lacking. This would mean that I would have to check (and be able to read) each Wikipedia page in each potentially interesting language. Moreover, I would have to carefully check shows one at a time, which is not convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, wikis for a series &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; contain information about dubs (e.g. a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikimoon.org/index.php?title=Sailor_Moon_in_Korea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/em&gt; wiki&lt;/a&gt; I found). As a general rule however, this is not the case. For instance, a Cantonese dub for &lt;em&gt;Revolutionary Girl Utena&lt;/em&gt; exists, but there is no mention of it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://utena.wikia.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a fan-made wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Cantonese (or even Mandarin), I can usually &quot;guess&quot; that older, more prominent shows will have a dub. However, I find it difficult to do the same for other languages that I might be interested in (e.g. German), and at any rate, it'd be nice to not have to rely on my guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38185">&lt;h1&gt;Translating web pages automatically with Google Translate&#176;&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This would mean that I would have to check (&lt;em&gt;and be able to read&lt;/em&gt;) each [&#8230;] page in each potentially interesting language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Translate goes a long way in helping that.  Although unfortunately its translations of Asian languages can still be tricky to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the Google Chrome browser, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; automatically offer to translate foreign pages (but does not consistently do so for me).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#176; Sorry this is not an answer to the question, but I find it so important, that I wanted it to be more visible.  (And then I ended up writing more than would fit into a comment.)  If the community objects, I will move this to a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the question, the translation enables you to apply the useful approach, suggested by the asker, of consulting the anime's page on the Wikipedia(s) of your desired dub language(s).  (Or opening foreign Google results.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Universalx?status=7" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Universalx?status=7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with its currently 1593 entries&lt;br&gt;
is an astonishingly comprehensive list maintained by a single user.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38188">&lt;h1&gt;Googling specific dub languages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=&amp;quot;cantonese&amp;quot;+dubbed+pretty+cure" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q="cantonese"+dubbed+pretty+cure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Putting single search terms within &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; double quotes&#160; makes sure they are actually present in the results.  (You could also apply that to the word &lt;code&gt;dubbed&lt;/code&gt;.))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tends to return YouTube videos of the Opening songs if the dub exists.  (Don't get confused by fandubs though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(I know this approach is super obvious, but I think it should be here for the sake of completeness and so it can be ranked against other approaches through votes.)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="13670" Title="How do cursed tools identify their owners?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I see that cursed tools pass from a owner to the next when the owner relinquish ownership (like when Haruaki asked Kirika to give him the Tragic Black River belt) or when the owner dies and someone claims ownership (the The Indigo Vessel and Rawhide FCD comes to mind).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since the curses normally affects their owners or people related to their owners, how exactly are the ownership given? Can tools decide to change ownership without killing their owners or with their owners relinquishing ownership?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="3328" Title="How can the man in the back see?"

&lt;p&gt;Because he takes care that nobody cheats in the exam, he must have an ability to sense things without using his eyes. It's most likely a special jutsu or Kekkai Genkai. &lt;/p&gt;

This makes me wonder what happens when fused character like &lt;em&gt;Vegito&lt;/em&gt; remove one or two of the earrings, will they be separated?

&lt;p&gt;Quote from the wiki - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The earrings have the ability to fuse two people into a single entity, substantially enhancing the abilities of both individuals. The resulting fusion lasts forever, even if the fused being removes the earrings. However, there is one instance where the Potara Fusion will be nullified and restore the fused being back to their original forms, which is when they are sucked into an environment that would not support it (as seen with Vegito being absorbed inside Buu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I've found a quote of Elder Kaioshin, stating that the Potara earrings are meant to be eternal-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Context: Elder Kaioshin gives the Potara to Goku Elder Kaioshin: &#8220;Here! Put
  this Potara on your left ear! [ ] Put the other one on Gohan&#8217;s ear.
  Just by doing that, you two will be able to merge together! Like with
  Fusion.&#8221; Goku: &#8220;Huh! Re-really!?&#8221; Elder Kaioshin: &#8220;Of course. And
  what&#8217;s more, the effect is greater than with Fusion! This has been the
  trump card treasure of the Kaioshins since long ago.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source - Chapter: 501 (DBZ 307), P6.2-6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Context: Goku asks how long Potara-based fusion lasts
  Elder Kaioshin: "The Potara don't have such a weakness. It's eternal! You'll never return to normal again!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source - Chapter: 501 (DBZ 307), P11.6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2 -
As jphager2 has mentioned in the comments below, after using the Potara Earrings, they can then be removed &amp;amp; re-used to fuse 2 new people, we've never been given information about the possibility of 2 fusions being able to fuse, and the only information I can find on it is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a character from a trading card game called &lt;strong&gt;Aquarian Age&lt;/strong&gt; (&#12450;&#12463;&#12456;&#12522;&#12450;&#12531;&#12456;&#12452;&#12472;). It is a Japanese collectible card game similar to Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the game, the player takes the role of a "Mindbreaker", who can
  control and unlock the powers of the game characters. The goal is to
  defeat other Mindbreakers (players) and to grow stronger. The game
  continues until the player has defeated all of their opponents, or has
  been stripped of their powers; thus being knocked out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Unlike similar TCG, the player fields game characters instead of
  spells. They must gain control over each character before it can be
  used in a game. If a player is unable to control a character properly,
  it may turn on them.&lt;/p&gt;

During his speech, he explains how he prevented revival of Majin Buu by killing Dabura and Babidi.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How could this be possible? Haven't Dabura and Babidi been killed in the current time line? How can someone who is killed exist in the future? Can you explain the logic here?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34004">&lt;p&gt;The future timeline already diverged from the main timeline when Trunks saved Goku. Think multiverse theory. Nothing that happens in the past has affected the future. That's the reason Cell existed in the future, even though he was killed in the past. It's also why all the characters remained dead, even though they were alive in the main timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That considered, the future timeline had its own unique past, where Babidi and Dabura weren't killed until they encountered Trunks.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="39724" Title="Why were the Chidori and Rasengan ever regarded as powerful jutsu?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The hard part about using the Chidori or Rasengan is making contact. If you make contact, the battle (should) be over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't see how having a Chidori or Rasengan is that much better than just using a kunai. Sure, a Chidori does more damage; but still, if you stab somebody with a kunai, the battle (should) be over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39725">&lt;p&gt;Look, first of all, stabbing someone with a kunai does not &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; end a battle. Second of all, those two justus are very complicated and hard to master, even control. By themselves, you can do a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rasengan is a dense ball of rotating chakra. A little chakra by itself is nothing, but if you harvest enough chakra to make a rasengan, you could so some serious damage. As your saw in Naruto Episode 95 (I think), Kabuto took a lot of damage when Naruto drove a Rasengan into him. See, Kabuto's cells can regenerate instantaneously, so it's pretty hard to do any damage to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand your view on the chidori. All we really see Sasuke and Kakashi do with it is plunge it into other's bodies. But still, the chidori requires a user to be able to have advanced chakra control. Just like one of the variations of the Rasengan, the Rasenshuriken, the user has to perform a change in chakra to create the chidori. There are many variations of this jutsu that are better than the basic chidori, like the chidori blade. But still, the chidori itself is really strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I don't see why a Rasengan vs. Chidori would end a battle. Besides, massive amounts of chakra can be very reactive when making contact with other strong sources of chakra.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39729">&lt;p&gt;Waiting "an hour or so" is neither a practical nor feasible option, especially considering the injured has that time to escape or heal or bandage their wounds, or worse yet, claim the upper hand in the battle. It would not be as easy as you claim it to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; is full of ridiculously strong characters who can take a lot more abuse than one kunai stab and come out fine. Against enemies with that kind of durability or regenerative ability, the raw power of jutsu like the Rasengan or Chidori is absolutely necessary to secure the fight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that they're not that much superior to a kunai because you can wait "an hour or so" for the enemy to bleed out is like playing an RPG using only starter gear. It's not practical unless you're fighting the weakest enemies, and you're going to get quickly outclassed and probably killed by the first enemy that decides to wear armor. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39753">&lt;p&gt;The point of Rasengan and Chidori is not just to make contact, but POWERFUL contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kunai can never penetrate Gaara's shield or any other strong defences, but Rasengan and Chidori can. Oodama Rasengan and Rasenshiriken are on even greater levels because their damages are astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fight with Kakuzu, before Naruto came, it was incredibly hard for the others to stall out Kakuzu, let alone finish him. But with Rasenshuriken, the destructibility penetrated and annihilated his charkra system in cellular level. I don't think you can do that with a kunai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of the Rasengan and Chidori is not limited to just "making contact". Charkra nature manipulation and shape manipulation comes into great meaning at this point: Sasuke can turn his Chidori into mini needles, arrows, sword (with adjustable length), and stream. Naruto can fuse his Sage charkra style into the Rasenshuriken to make it a flying disk of destruction. This can't be accomplished with a simple kunai.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="46443">&lt;p&gt;To be honest in early Naruto it (rasengan) seems to be more of a cool trick than anything else. It doesn't do that much more damage than a kunai and takes time AND a shadow clone to make. To its defense it does send the enemy flying and seems to be somewhat of a superpowered punch that can do some series internal damage, but from the complexity of its use and the time required you could throw 10-20 kunai in the time it takes to use it. Even though I do have to admit its a whole lot better when fighting stronger enemies, like in the fight with Kabuto. Against an enemy at that level a kunai wouldn't be able to do enough damage, but most importantly they could dodge or deflect them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion I would say that Rasengan, while a good technique to know for last ditch efforts against a superior enemy, seems to be a waste of chakra for anyone who isn't Naruto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side note for chidori, it seems to be a slightly weaker version of Rasengan. We see this when Naruto and Sasuke fight before Sasuke leaves, they both have similar levels of base chakra yet Naruto's attack does a noticeably bigger amount of damage to that water tank. Also from the type of damage dealt it seems fair to say that Rasengan was better at penetration. (as in basically a giant punch)&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In OVA 2 of Nanatsu no Taizai, Gilthunder says about Meliodas and Ban, &quot;They arent simple holy knights, it is said the 2 of them are the strongests of The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this true? I thought Escanor was said to be the strongest. Moreover, the power levels figures which appears for Ban dont look any special (it's said that after the Hunter Festival he's stronger than that, probably higher than a weakened Galand, with this he still could be weaker than several members) , and also if I recall correctly in the first season it's mentioned Diane it's the physically strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is it true Gilthunder statement about Meliodas and Ban being the strongest nanatsu no taizai members?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="55986">&lt;p&gt;The tricky thing with calling someone the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;strongest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in any show is that it is very quickly opinion based. One could say that Escanor is easily the strongest member of the group because he just obliterates everyone he sees. Meliodas has his full-counter move which is also a feature one could use to call him the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;strongest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Ban is immortal. He litterally can't die. This feature of Ban could be used to argue that he is the strongest member (he also has the whole muscle buff mode thingie). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point I am trying to make here is that (in the way i see it) Gilthunder &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Meliodas and Ban to be the strongest members based on things he knows/has seen. I don't believe that you should take his statement 100% at face value when it comes to actual power level scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

He was human and as much as it is shown, he wasn't madly in love with Maria (she was just a test subject for him, said by Father Juliano). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, why was Solomon so afraid of witches? Because witches were more powerful? Fine but if they despised witches so much, then why were they having conflicts with Zaizen? Zaizen wanted to eradicate witches completely, and so did Solomon. Just their means were different. And even the means could be justified because they hated witches, so creating Orbo was legal from their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="40274" Title="Which was the name of this Rurouni Kenshin song?"

It doesn't make sense, doesn't that mean anyone can get up there now or what? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40230">&lt;p&gt;The level of technology was always ambiguous in DB. Sometimes it felt like they were in the dark ages but at the same time capsules and androids existed. Still, it stands to reason that if Bulma has the iq and resources to solve space and time travel, there is probably no place too high in her own atmosphere for her to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40259">&lt;p&gt;in DB Bulma was a teenager on a summer vacation trying to find the dragon balls. and even though their technology is pretty high at the time I guess they don't have the &lt;strong&gt;appropriate&lt;/strong&gt;  tech to reach there.&lt;br&gt;
But in the early stages of DBZ we see people coming to earth from far away planets and bringing new technology with them. Bulma has grown in to an adult and is now more knowledgeable, and by having access to the space pod she figured out how it works.&lt;br&gt;
Then we see Bulma gaining access to a Namekian space ship and seeing how she changed the language and used the space ship we could say she now has it's technology as well.&lt;br&gt;
So if you can travel to outer space why wouldn't you be able to get to Kami house?&lt;br&gt;
And I don't think anyone can go there now. Kami's house is considered a holy palace and I don't think Bulma would expose it to everyone. So even if she can go there, doesn't mean she will share the tech with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

I've got the basics, but I want to know the details.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, a Demon Weapon is a person who can transform into a weapon. Alone they aren't much of a threat, but paired with a Weapon Meister the two are very powerful. But later in the Soul Eater series we see how some Weapons and Meisters pose a serious threat on their own, but they look trained and experienced, so it seems to be more of a guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the first few episodes there's talk about 100-soul ritual, where a Demon Weapon has to consume 99 Kishin eggs and 1 witch soul. The Weapon is supposed to level up after that somehow, and the effects of that aren't very clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that hints at the magnitude of such upgrade is that Death uses Maka's father as his weapon, him being a Death Weapon. It's like the two most powerful guys in the show together, yet not much is apparent about how it affects their power (both Meister and Weapon).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, we see some Meisters teamed up with more than one Weapon. They can resonate their souls and it somehow works for them. It seems this is kind of the same as multiple Weapon-Meister combos resonating all of their souls together. But what about combos with only Weapons and only Meisters? Would that work?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm also confused about how a basic Weapon and an upgraded one should be called. Are they Demon Weapons or Death Weapons?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What does completing this 100-soul ritual do for Weapon and Meister?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What about combos with 1 Weapon and &gt;1 Meisters?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What are the basic and upgraded Weapons called?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Soul Eater Not! just started airing, possibly shedding more light on the mechanics of that world, but I guess the answers to these questions can be found in Soul Eater.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8647">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What are the basic and upgraded Weapons called?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start with this since i'll use these terms in my answers, in the Anime, weapons like Soul and Tsubaki are known as &lt;em&gt;Death Weapons&lt;/em&gt;. After they collect the 100 souls they are refereed to as &lt;em&gt;Death Scythes&lt;/em&gt; like Spirit and Justin, most likely a reference to how Lord Death is the Grim Reaper and in most works the Grim Reaper is portrayed to have a Scythe, these terms will be different depending on which version but for simplicity i'll use the anime terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems in the manga the 2 forms are Demon Weapon and Death scythes (&#12487;&#12473;&#12469;&#12452;&#12474;&#12473; desu saizusu) so I use the anime terms as Soul is refereed to as a demon scythe and using the anime terms avoid any confusion thinking Soul is somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What does completing this 100-soul ritual do for Weapon and Meister?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, you ask about the effects of the ritual, to answer this you need to know what does collecting souls do for the Death Weapon. When a Death Weapon consumes a soul they get more powerful, the amount of power depends on thew soul they consume, Bellow are the list from the weakest to the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kishin Eggs (Red with a forming Shell) are the weakest however since they can give birth to a Kishin the DWMA seeks these out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human souls (Normally Blue) are used to refer to the souls of humans who are innocent, ie. have done no wrong. They give quite a bit of power compared to Kishin Eggs however the DWMA looks down on this as you'll be murdering innocent people to get them and beginning down the road of becoming a Kishin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witch Souls (Normally Purple) give the most because of the magic Witches use however a witch is "normally" very hard to kill (exception may possible be Angela Leon due to her age)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 99-Kishin/1-Witch Ritual is used to train both the Death Weapon and Meister so they can handle the power slowly growing without loosing control, it's probably that by collecting 99 Kishin Eggs gives a Weapon/Meister pair the experience and power they need to tackle the witch, look at Blair who was a handful to Maka and Soul but wasn't even a witch and then to Maka's expression when she saw Medusa's soul for the first time in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final Witch Soul must give enough power to the Death Weapon to rival a Death Scythe as Death Normally chooses the target Witches not only comparing against the Weapon/Meister pair's skill but probably also the amount of power the Death Weapon will need to be considered as a Death Scythe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death Scythes are then assigned an area to manage in Death's place (due to his soul being anchored to Death City) probably to replace the Great Old Ones AKA Death's Eight Guardians which were once commanded by Death himself (back when he had the more monstrous look). We know  the fate of 6 of the eight, Asura become a Kishin and killed 3 of them, one is in the Book of Eibon in the form of a black, amorphous blob and another is Eibon, the fate of the other 2 is unknown. Most likely before the DWMA Death's Eight Guardians managed the world so with their disappearance/fall Death created the DWMA (and became more funny looking to not scare children) and started training Death Scythes to replace them, so far there are 8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spirit Albarn - North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marie Mjolnir - Oceania&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azusa Yumi - Eastern Asia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Law - Western Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tezca Tlipoca - South America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tsar Pushka - Eastern Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deng Dinga and Djinn Galland - Africa and Western Asia (How Wikipedia list them, not sure which is which)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not sure what happens to new Death Scythes with all the regions now managed but in the manga Justin Law is killed so the Western Europe slot is open and in the Manga Soul Becomes a Death Scythe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what happens to the Meister that's not entirely know (at least to me), hopefully &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6649/what-happens-to-the-miester-when-they-complete-a-death-scythe"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; will give the answer to that (will edit this part when it is answered)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What about combos with 1 Weapon and &gt;1 Meisters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Other way around (&gt;1 Weapon and 1 Meisters) which is more common I only know of 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death the Kid: His weapons are Elizabeth and Patricia Thompson, the 2 were already guns using each other to mug people in Brooklyn and originally join Kid to exploit his wealth and authority as a Grim Reaper, but grow closer to Kid over time and outgrow their greed. Kid took an interest in them because of his crippling obsessive-compulsive disorder for symmetry however Kid wasn't a normal student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilik Rung: his is Pot of Fire and Pot of Thunder, twin brother and sister, respectively, who never speak but have the ability to communicate with nature and sense danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know of too many other Weapon/Meister pairs which have more that 1 Weapon but it's probably assumed that if a weapon has a sibling who they are very close too most likely the Meister will accept them as another weapon. I would assume these kind of weapons can be worked together but i haven't read up on too many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Weapon/Meister only groups that would be very rare, in the Anime, there is a kid called Hero who didn't have a Death Weapon and was able to put up with Excalibur but ended up putting him back because of Excalibur's sniffling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meisters who work by themselves can manipulate their Soul Wavelength like Stein and Black Star however Stein originally was paired with Spirit, it's not known if he had a second partner (sympathy to the poor soul if there was). It's probably safe to assume that all students who do missions have a Death Weapon unless there is a very good reason for that, as it would go against one of the main reasons of the DWMA (Training Death Weapons to Death Scythes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death Weapons that work alone normally shapeshift part of their body into a weapon, almost every Death Weapon can do this, however Weapon duos like the Pot Twins or the Thompson Sisters can use one another; likewise with the Death Scythes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, pairs are normally stronger. In the Anime, Death explains how a Meister can use their Soul Wavelength alone, but it's amplified when they wield a Death Weapon (shown as Maka playing an acoustic guitar alone then plugging up an electric guitar rocking out as Soul sits on the Amplifier) so the stronger either are by themselves, the even stronger they are together &#8722; this is why Spirit and Stein are so strong together as Stein is already very powerful on his own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other away around in the Anime, Death Scythes seem to be used by others other than Lord Death; Spirit, Azusa Yumi and Marie Mjolnir mainly, however before becoming a Death Scythe Spirit was originally with Stein before partnering with Maka's mother Kami however Stein and Kami weren't his Meisters at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other that i have heard of is Tsugumi Harudori from Not! however she befriends 2 Meisters and is indecisive about which one of them to choose as her partner which means she doesn't actually have a partner just yet. You might be able to count Excalibur having multiple Meisters, but you'd be hard press to find any who would actully admit to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there's Soul Wavelength Comparability to factor in, Black Star couldn't even wield Soul claiming he couldn't even pick him up. Tsubaki on the other hand is probably the only stated Death Weapon who could have multiple Meisters due to her accepting nature which allows for such a strong resonance with Black Star's seemingly polar opposite nature to Tsubaki, Stein mentions this when he is analyzing everyone's Soul Wavelengths during the 2nd part of the remedial class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Soul Eater Not! just started airing, possibly shedding more light on the mechanics of that world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soul Eater Not! follows the daily lives of Tsugumi and her friends as they learn the ropes of the DWMA and have occasional encounters with the characters of the main series so it'll probably give more light on how the DWMA/Death City works and possibly link it to how the rest of the world works, but I think it'll mostly answer question about the DWMA.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="8821" Title="Is Bebe the magical girl that gave birth to Charlotte?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the original universe covered in the anime and the movies, in Episode 3 / Movie 1, Mami is killed by the dessert witch Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the Rebellion movie, Charlotte is in Homura's labyrinth as Mami's partner called Bebe, and we find out that Bebe is actually a magical girl whose attacks seemed like they are based on Charlotte's attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is Bebe the magical girl who gave birth to the witch Charlotte?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8823">&lt;p&gt;Basically, Bebe, Charlotte, and Nagisa Momoe are three different names for the same entity. Nagisa Momoe was her name in life; Charlotte is her name as a witch; and Bebe is what the characters call her in Rebellion because they don't know that her witch-name is Charlotte. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: the only reason we (the viewers) know the names of the witches (e.g. Charlotte, Oktavia, Kriemhild Gretchen) is because their names show up in the runes. As far as we know, though, the characters in the show don't see the runes, and even if they do, they presumably can't read them. So even though &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; know that the witch that kills Mami in episode 3 is named Charlotte, the characters &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when Charlotte shows up in Rebellion, the characters need to call her &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. In keeping with Mami's fondness for Italian, she seems to have picked the name "Bebe" (which, with some accents in the right place, means "baby"). Of course, they eventually find out that when she was a human, her name was Nagisa Momoe. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I noticed that when Light Yagami got the Death Note he became evil, so it made me wonder if the Death Note has the ability to corrupt a human user.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27348">&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, a person becomes corrupt if he gets the power to kill a person. So, not only a death note, but the power to kill people is itself, evil.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27350">&lt;p&gt;The death note itself does not affect the users mind at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is compareable to a gun just stronger/more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27352">&lt;p&gt;"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the Death Note does not change the owner's will to corrupt him directly.  Light, though, is corrupted by his rather insane ploy for power and world domination.  While he almost immediately exhibits megalomania, he seems to try to morally justify his actions.  By the end, he views himself as a God and cannot fathom his failure or that his actions are somehow wrong. Misa Misa, however, seems detached from those under her feet and doesn't seem to give much mind to whether her actions are moral at all. It seems that the Shinigami's expect this kind of behavior from human's given this power but they are too surprised by it to be directly bringing it about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When comparing to other shops, only Gamers have its original name shown with proper logo while others were changed. This gives a big hint that it's a product placement deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Gamers itself has done some tie-ups/collaborations with &lt;em&gt;Love Live!&lt;/em&gt; series itself. Some examples are bonus merchandise for &lt;em&gt;Love Live!&lt;/em&gt; products (anime Blu-Ray, CD singles).&lt;/p&gt;

They could have kept all the brand and billboard the same as they are in real life, but instead, they made so many subtle changes (while the maid cafe remains almost entirely intact).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since many of these easter eggs are placed in a very obvious position, and animating such a complicated background asks a large amount of effort. I don't really believe these are purely the animator having fun. Are there any other reasons? Like copyright or advertising? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

&lt;p&gt;Replacing brand names is a fairly common phenomenon in media. As &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51011/why-oreimo-changed-the-actual-brand-name-in-akihabara#comment65979_51011"&gt;Dimitri mx mentions&lt;/a&gt;, this is probably because the studios want to avoid using &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark" rel="noreferrer"&gt;trademarks&lt;/a&gt; to play it safe. This is why parody names like "WcDonalds" and "EcDonalds" are so common in anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toradora&lt;/em&gt; casts a snarky lampshade on this practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/animeoffbrands/comments/7q966u/sudohbucks/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RC7ZY.png" alt="&amp;quot;Sudoh-bucks&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Why hasn&amp;#39;t this place been sued yet?&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the anime actually does use the real names, if they get the product placement properly arranged behind the scenes. For example, this was the case with Pizza Hut in &lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;. (Hence the "Pizza Hut supports the Rebellion" memes.) For more detail, see &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4257/have-there-been-any-anime-with-actual-product-placement"&gt;Have there been any anime with actual product placement?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, taking the steps to formally arrange this kind of thing requires more effort and comes with more risk, so I can see why anime productions tend to go with the less risky parody names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi_Score_Girl" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Score Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This manga got into legal trouble because it directly featured lots of 90s video game content, even though its publisher, Square Enix, took steps to secure formal consent for the use of the games' characters from the various companies. In 2014, SNK Playmore &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-06/hi-score-girl-manga-recalled-after-snk-copyright-charges/.77361" rel="noreferrer"&gt;launched an IP violation claim&lt;/a&gt; against Square Enix because of this manga, which resulted in the recall of all the volume and digital publications of the manga. It took about a year before the two parties reached a settlement and the lawsuit was withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case had more to do with copyright than trademark, but it's still a good example of the kind of trouble that could come arise if you're not careful enough with handling the intellectual property of others... &lt;em&gt;High Score Girl&lt;/em&gt; really did include a lot of stuff though, so this was a particularly complex case. For reference, here's the copyright notice in volume 1 of the manga:&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="43660">&lt;p&gt;From what I have read, this also includes the epilogue they may release more but perhaps under a different name since the Rosario was destroyed and the name &lt;em&gt;Rosario + Vampire&lt;/em&gt; is no longer able to be referenced due to that simple fact, and Tsukune is a vampire now and the outer Moka is gone. Perhaps the name would be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also said that "Yoshii Kiria took over fairy tail" and then state "but let's save that story for another time". At least from what I understand of the wording, it is passable for a continuation of &lt;em&gt;Rosario + Vampire&lt;/em&gt;, but would most likely no longer be called that anymore.

Body="&lt;p&gt;Most of the villains to most of the kages were reincarnated but Why wasn't Jiraya reincarnated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kabuto reincarnated almost everyone from the past during the war and the presence of Jiraya could've been too helpful for him.But my question is what was the reason for reincarnating him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43717">&lt;p&gt;Reincarnation done the way Kabuto chose to do it requires the body of the person being reincarnated and a host body. This is told to the third hokage by Orochimaru in the Naruto series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiraiya dies while fighting pain and sinks to the bottom of the ocean. Since his body was never preserved and buried, Kabuto could not revive him along with the others.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Why wasn't naruto adopted when he was young, I mean if he is by himself, the 9 tails power might come out without anyone realizing. If he had a family unit, he would have been able to control his loneliness and therefore maybe helping him control his 9 tails power better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43010">&lt;p&gt;The general stigma of Naruto having the 9-tails made people fear him. It's a core point of his character development and central to the story of how he travels the path of deliquent ninja - Hokage and the villages strongest.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="8500" Title="What is an ONA?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Searching through MAL and other anime sites, I found an unfamiliar type of anime. What is an &quot;ONA&quot;? Is it different from a OVA?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcWZK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;types of anime on MAL&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8501">&lt;p&gt;ONA and OVA are completely different in terms of their target markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Original Net Animation (ONA) is an anime that is directly released onto the Internet&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; while an Original Video Animation (OVA) is an animated film or series made specially for release in home-video formats.&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The term ONA was first coined by the creators of Lingerie Fighter Papillon Rose and Anime News Network decided to adopt it for use in the encyclpedia since&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was no other word to describe this new format of anime.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We felt "ONA" was an original and appropriate denomination.&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many ONAs are designed as side stories to an existing franchise, or are simply promotional vehicles. The ONA Hitotsubu ni Kawaranu Ai wo Komete, for instance, was created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Morinaga Milk Caramel candy. HALO Legends tells several standalone stories in the universe of the HALO video game.&lt;sup&gt;(4)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of ONAs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/3167/Eve_no_Jikan" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Eve no Jikan&lt;/a&gt; (before it was made into a movie)&lt;/li&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I watched an animation about Sonic, and that hedgehog became a Super Saiyan using diamond shaped stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What actually is that? How can Sonic become like that?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47237">&lt;p&gt;I think you're refering to what's commonly known as &lt;a href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Sonic" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Super Sonic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonic has had the ability to turn into Super Sonic using &lt;a href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Chaos_Emerald" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Chaos Emerald&lt;/a&gt; since the 2nd game. Various media have handeled this transformation in various ways (see the Wikia-page linked above), but in general he's seen as a yellow or golden version of himself. He usually gain enhanced speed and an ability to fly and/or to survive in outer space. At least in the games, this is often at expense of &lt;a href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Ring" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformation is &lt;em&gt;not directly linked&lt;/em&gt; to Super Saiyans, but it's widely believed that the game drew heavy inspiration from Dragon Ball in this regard. (No official confirmation, tough.)&lt;/p&gt;

I only watched the sample couple of episodes on the DVD and remember liking it, but don't remember anything else about it.  I would have seen this at some point between 1998-2000.

</answer></question><question Id="30531" Title="Is there a reference to Zenki in Japanese mythology? Or did Shaman King intentionally reference Zenki (anime/manga)?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the Shaman King series, Hao (and later Anna) used to take control of two beasts named Zenki and Goki (or Kouki), which look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTkUb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zenki and Goki from Shaman King&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This immediately reminded me of Zenki and Goki from &quot;Zenki&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eL7IT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zenki and Goki from &amp;quot;Zenki&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So: Is there a relation between both series? (perhaps authors were friends...) Or is Zenki a japanese mythology character? Or... what's the reason behind the reference?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="30534">&lt;p&gt;I have no prior knowledge here, so I'm mostly summarizing Japanese articles here. (English information on these beings exists, but is difficult to find because it's mostly swamped by &lt;em&gt;Shaman King&lt;/em&gt;-related websites.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%89%8D%E9%AC%BC%E3%83%BB%E5%BE%8C%E9%AC%BC" rel="nofollow"&gt;Zenki and Goki&lt;/a&gt; are, respectively, a male &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;oni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a female &lt;em&gt;oni&lt;/em&gt; ("ogres", if you will) who are married to one another. Their names mean, respectively, "&lt;em&gt;oni&lt;/em&gt; of the fore" and "&lt;em&gt;oni&lt;/em&gt; of the rear". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are said to have been attendants to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_no_Gy%C5%8Dja" rel="nofollow"&gt;En-no-Ozuno&lt;/a&gt;, who is the founder of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugend%C5%8D" rel="nofollow"&gt;Shugend&#333;&lt;/a&gt;, a syncretic derivative of Buddhism that is indigenous to Japan. Depictions of En-no-Ozuno very commonly feature these two &lt;em&gt;oni&lt;/em&gt; flanking him. See, for example, the piece "En no Gy&#333;ja, Eight Boy Attendants
&amp;amp; Two Demon Attendants (Zenki &amp;amp; Goki)" shown in &lt;a href="http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shugendou.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this article on Shugend&#333;&lt;/a&gt; (by the way, that website is incredibly fascinating if you're interested in Buddhist symbology and art, and is a true wonder of the internet) - Zenki appears to the immediate bottom left of the central figure, and Goki to the immediate bottom right. The linked article also includes some narratives about these figures. See &lt;a href="http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shugendou.html#twodemons" rel="nofollow"&gt;the section titled "Two Demon Attendants / Servants of Enno Gy&#333;ja"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know nothing about &lt;em&gt;Shaman King&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Kishin D&#333;ji Zenki&lt;/em&gt;; anyone who does should feel free to write an answer pointing out any pertinent details about how either of those things relates to the mythological Zenki and Goki.&lt;/p&gt;

The way he mentions it and the way Conan responds makes it seem like it is obvious they both knew about it at this point. When did Professor Agasa add this feature to Conan's glasses?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="33828">&lt;p&gt;according to the detective conan wiki:4
Agasa updated the glasses so they can zoom in on a distant target and enhance visibility, even in the dark.
As of the anime episode The Unsmashable Snowman and Volume 54, Conan's glasses can only have some form of magnifying lens. This lens is on the right, according to the manga, while the Criminal Tracking Glasses feature is on the left lens. Movie 8 and Movie 11 are the only appearances that uses the left lens for the telescopic feature. Because movies are non-canon, it is unknown whether Conan's glasses have this modification on both lenses in conjunction with the criminal tracking feature, or if one modification would instead interfere with the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was never stated when Agasa updated the lenses, and there is only a few appearances.
Hope this helps&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I think you can have two (or possibly more) interpretations for this. One being a dance or music; the other being to accomplish something with little to no effort. Are these two interpretations correct or is it just the former that's correct?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23841">&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find a source that explicitly stated the meaning to the name of the episode. I agree with your interpretations with both of them fitting moments in the episode. So let's break down the episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;a href="http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Waltz_For_Venus" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waltz for Venus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venus is the setting for most of this episode so that fits just fine, the challenge is what the waltz stands for as. Stated on Merriam Webster the word &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waltz" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waltz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can be a dance/music with a time signature of 3/4. This particular definition doesn't seem to have any real relevance to the episode, but if we take the whole timeframe in which &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Rocco_Bonnaro" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rocco Bonnaro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is eluding &lt;a href="http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Piccaro_Calvino" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piccaro Calvino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this could be considered a "dance".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I say this because &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dance" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a verb can mean to move quickly or nimbly. This is why sometimes in sports, for example American football, sometimes sports announcers will say a player "danced around the defense", meaning they eluded the defense. So I don't think it is that much a stretch to say Rocco was "dancing" away from Piccaro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reference from the episode that can be used is when &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Spike_Spiegel" rel="nofollow"&gt;Spike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Faye_Valentine" rel="nofollow"&gt;Faye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; take a commercial shuttle into Venus. They are doing this to catch some hijackers and defeat them very easily. This ties into the other definition of waltz being used as a verb and means to "to succeed at something easily".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is in no way 100% the reason as to why the episode is titled this way but merely an interpretation as to why it could be.  &lt;/p&gt;

Cooler is an antagonist and is a character who wants to eradicate the Saiyans just like Freiza. There is absolutely no reason for him to turn &lt;i&gt;"Good"&lt;/i&gt;, as that would imply, Cooler would be willing to fight Frieza to protect Goku and the rest of the Saiyans, which doesn't make sense. Cooler certainly hates Frieza and would destroy him if he had the chance. You could compare it to a relationship between Early Vegeta and Goku, where Vegeta would destroy Goku by himself if he could but you wouldn't necessarily see him join an arch enemy like Frieza and help him defeat Goku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe just like Dragon Ball Fighter Z and even in the tournament of power, Cooler has possibly teamed up with the Saiyans to take out an even greater threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;How do Chi Chi's strength compare to the rest of the Z-Fighters. Since she managed to train Goten who is immsensely strong, is she stronger than Mr. Satan&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48026">&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chi Chi does not have the ability to use Ki and also cannot fly. Hence, that would automatically make her weaker than the rest of the Z-Fighters. Even in terms of Physical Strength, Chi Chi's power is substantially weaker than even Yamcha.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only fighter she might be comparable to in &lt;b&gt; terms of Physical strength&lt;/b&gt; would be Chiaotzu. She did have a higher power level than him during the martial arts tournament. However, Chiaotzu with his psychic abilities would easily win. Also, Chi Chi was a lot younger at the time of the martial arts tournament and hence must've grown weaker with age.&lt;li&gt;Training Goten doesn't imply Chi Chi is strong. Goku, who is at a Universe busting level of strength, would still train under Master Roshi. Even if Goten is born with massive physical strength, he would require someone to teach him basic Martial Arts which Chi Chi is definitely aware of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you were to compare Chi Chi with Videl, one can easily conclude Videl is stronger in terms of physical strength and also, the fact that she is aware of using Ki and can also fly. With regard to Satan, it's pretty hard to determine who exactly of the two is stronger. Satan is often underestimated in terms of power when he as a matter of fact, did win all those Tournaments the Z fighters didn't take part in(And only cheated against Android 18). We also see him manage to pull 3 buses just by himself which I highly doubt Chi Chi would be capable to do. At the same time, Chi Chi has way better Martial Arts training in comparison to Mr. Satan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, if the two of them were to fight, I personally believe Chi Chi would most likely win under all circumstances. Mr. Satan is known for underestimating all his opponents heavily and spends half his fight showboating and would easily be caught off guard by Chi Chi. At the same time, Mr. Satan doesn't have the Raw Power to take out Chi Chi in one blow and hence Chi Chi's advantage in technique, might get the better of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the last episode of season 3 of the anime A certain magical index, Accelerator who is an esper turned into an angel. Why did this happen? Can he do this at will?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="54191">&lt;p&gt;Remember the level 6 experiment? Well, he was more than halfway through. So if level 6 is some sort of ascendant tier esper, what's an ascendant tier magic user then? A magic god (you'll learn about those in index new testament)? A saint? An angel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well if we say that an ascendant magic user is an angel, then an ascendant esper would be like some sort of science angel right? A science angel seems like an apt description of accelerator's winged power.&lt;/p&gt;

While it's clear what events took place, I don't understand why some of the characters did what they did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, why does Takuto decide to break Wako's seal to unleash the cybodies into the normal world?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsZxj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For the entire series:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Glittering Crux Brigade seeks to break the seal of all 4 maidens to achieve the 5th phase.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Takuto was pretty much fighting against them for the entire series to stop this process.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why, in the final episode, does he &quot;change his mind&quot; and break Wako's seal?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Note that is it implied that Wako actually allows Takuto to break her seal.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2370">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was because he wanted to save Sugata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugata wanted to seal Samekh with him forever, meaning he wanted to sacrifice himself. And Takuto wanted to save him, that's why he broke Wako's seal. Takuto's only chance of saving him was to break Wako's seal to unseal the Zero Time. Wako wanted to save Sugata as well that's why she allowed Takuto to break her seal, agreeing both without a single word (which was just amazing for me!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I answered your question clear. This is purely based on my understanding of the ending. :)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="46964" Title="Can Katsuki Bakugo fly as much as he wants with his explosion quirk?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In My Hero Academia, we see several times Bakugo using his explosion quirk to lift himself to mid-air and fly to increase his speed. How much can he uses this technique to fly? Can he fly as much as he wants or is he limited to fly a few metres above the ground?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="46967">&lt;p&gt;I can't remember this being elaborated in the manga, but since it is very serious of the mechanics of the quirks, we can find out ourselves. I'll use this &lt;a href="http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Katsuki_Bakugo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; as reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Katsuki's Quirk allows him to sweat nitroglycerin from his palms and detonate it at will to create explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as long as he sweats, he can fly. This effect is in fact achieved by being on the right side of the shock wave of the explosion. However:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These explosions, especially when used repeatedly in rapid succession, were actually shown to have a negative impact on Katsuki's arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is a limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To actually fly and not just "jump" midair, he would need to navigate the explosions constantly, adjusting their strength and also needing a really big amount stored if he wants to fly long distances, which on the other hand he needs to carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if Bakugo wanted to fly, think of him as an Iron Man without repulsors in his shoes (allowing him only to navigate and accelerate/decelerate with the hands) on short fuel with every second of the repulsors being on taking a burden on his arms. Not really flying.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="46969">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;Dr&lt;/strong&gt; Bakugo isn't flying at all. He is jumping and augmenting himself using his Explosion quirk. There is no actual flying involved, though he may seem to be floating (much like Midoriya) in the slowmos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see him do the exact same thing multiple times throughout the anime/manga. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does this when he sent threw the baseball flying or the sprint/long jump in the Quick Apprehension Test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFq1Fm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFq1Fm.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He shows more adaptability with his precision and control by jumping and changing directions during the Trial Battle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rc6ce.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rc6ce.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main proof his "inability" to fly while jumping really high comes during the Sports Festival. Cero had to use tape to control his dissent. If he could maneuver himself, Cero wouldn't have needed to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1milpm.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1milpm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most lengthy and continuous use of his explosion is the so called "Special Move" used by Bakugo using his explosions to rotate while propelling himself like a bullet, the Howitzer Blast seen in finals vs Todoroki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Also, note how Beerus says he asked "the dinosaur guy with the nasty attitude" to destroy Earth. In "Battle of Gods" Beerus says this a little differently--he says he is the one who destroyed all the dinosaurs on Earth. This could be an error in translation, or it could be Toyotaro changing it up, since we all know dinosaurs are still alive and well on planet Earth in Dragon Ball (I explain how that is at the bottom of my "Battle of Gods" post). Maybe this "dinosaur guy" is someone we'll meet eventually? Maybe it's a reference to King Piccolo or Babadi? Or maybe it's just an off-handed joke to a Godzilla-like kaiju that'll never be followed up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could well be a translation error as &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Beerus" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dragon Ball Wikia&lt;/a&gt; confirms what Beerus said in &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beerus also claims that he once went to Earth, and dinosaurs took a rude attitude toward him, so he wiped them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be revealed in the future or be kept as a mystery element. Only Akira sensei knows how its going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34411">&lt;p&gt;I have a theory the dinosaur guy maybe kami before he extracted piccolo from him but then he saw the beauty in earth and decided to protect it rather than destroy it that's just my guess though&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;What kind of creatures are these Tailed Beasts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know they are the summation of huge amount of chakra and a body. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they are just chakra, can't the chakra itself be the body? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What do Tailed Beasts need the body for?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5723">&lt;p&gt;Bijuu are living beings, same as humans and animals. They were &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; by the Sage of Six Paths, using the Creation of All Things technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sage created the vessels with Yin, breathed life into them with Yang, then poured the Ten Tails' chakra into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chakra is merely energy. It cannot take complex physical form (With the exception of the Creation of All Things, which uses chakra to create form).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5749">&lt;p&gt;As per what has been revealed.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juubi (Shinju) was initially a Tree before taking the beast form.&lt;br&gt;
This tree produced one single fruit every 1000 years. And it was considered as a forbidden fruit and should not be consumed by anyone.&lt;br&gt;
However, this law was broken by a princess name Kaguya &#332;tsutsuki and she gained unbelievable amount of power, which she used to end all the wars and clear lands.&lt;br&gt;
Then, Kaguya gave birth to the first human with chakra. He was called Hagoromo.&lt;br&gt;
Then came the awakening of the Ten Tails due to the mistake made by Kaguya.&lt;br&gt;
The Ten Tails went on rampage and started destroying everything.&lt;br&gt;
Hagoromo somehow managed to defeat it and sealed it within himself. This made him the Sage of Six Paths.&lt;br&gt;
Hagoromo separated the monster's chakra from its body before using Chibaku Tensei to seal the husk in what would become the moon.&lt;br&gt;
Then he used his Creation of All Things ability to divide the chakra into the nine Tailed Beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, this is basically chakra which is stored in a vessel.  Here the Tailed Beasts are just vessels.
You can even consider it as 9 different beasts which were originally normal animals, but they got their powers when the Sage gave them chakra. That can be a reason why every Tailed Beast resembles a particular animal.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="13673">&lt;p&gt;There aren't really dedicated "suggestion engines" for anime. your best bet is looking through places like [MyAnimeList] or [AnimePlanet]. Otherwise, you can go through something like &lt;a href="http://thatanimesite.tv/anime-list/" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, scroll through to something that has genres you like, and look for whether or not it is highly rated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, there are plenty of websites you can go to that will give you info about series, recommendations, suggestions, etc., but nothing with a dedicated system. Just use a bunch'a different sites, and you won't go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14419">&lt;p&gt;Just to add to the list, there's also &lt;a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=main" rel="noreferrer"&gt;anidb&lt;/a&gt; which will also provide related, similar, and random anime recommendations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just type any anime you like, &lt;em&gt;e.g. "One Piece" or "Hunter x Hunter"&lt;/em&gt;, and it shows you a bunch of similar animes from which you can choose whatever catches your eyes, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I only tried it once and I searched "Nagi no Asukara" and found "Elfen Lied", and I really liked it, okay?)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38160">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anidb.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;AniDB&lt;/a&gt; also has a recommendation feature. To use it, you need to add the series and episodes you watched to your AniDB MyList. Most importantly, you also need to &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; the series from 1 to 10 (10 being best).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system then uses some hidden algorithm based on what you voted and what others voted and thereby predicts your votes for series you have not yet watched. You can even remove recommendations from the prediction list if you say &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to watch that, stop telling me I&#8217;m going to rate it with a 9&#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for recommendations to work best, you should attempt to vote in a way that puts your median at 5.5 and resembles a standard distribution. While the system &#8216;corrects&#8217; votes for overall series ratings, if you use exaggerated votes you will also receive exaggerated vote predictions (such as 13, which is obviously larger than 10).&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="39574">&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;adding another answer since this is a drastically different way to go about it&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="http://affinity.animesos.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;affinity.animesos.net&lt;/a&gt; to search for other people that share your tastes (based on mal's affinity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/twWbM.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/twWbM.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, someone with &gt;95% affinity! Click their name to see their profile, then simply click the "~ shared" link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfTfJ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfTfJ.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend sorting by score and first looking at what you two agreed on and what you didn't to be able to gauge where their tastes will apply to you, then just scroll down to the "Unique to [them]" section to add some of their favourites to your plan-to-watch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure though; see how the affinity search said we only shared 11, yet mal says we share 79? Mal includes the unscored entries as items able to be common between people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/shared.php?u1=_Arris_&amp;amp;u2=Hashbrown777&amp;amp;type=anime&amp;amp;o=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here's a link to the comparison page&lt;/a&gt;, we might not be a great pair to extrapolate our opinions to each other.&lt;br&gt;
So I bumped the search requirements to only use people with 50 shared titles, and that dropped my closest match to 69% affinity, &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/shared.php?u1=Oliver255&amp;amp;u2=Hashbrown777&amp;amp;type=anime&amp;amp;o=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;but have a look at our comparisons page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be a much more useful match to find new anime, especially if I work my way down the result list and see any titles that continue to pop up in a lot of peoples lists. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="44044" Title="Does the word &quot;chuunibyou&quot; originate from the anime &quot;Chuunibyou&quot;?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt; and realized that Lotton is a bit like a chuunibyou. He called himself &quot;The Wizard&quot; and he always wanted to make a cool entrance before a fight but usually got his ass kicked quickly. In my opinion, he's a chuuninbyou. But no one ever mention that he's chuunibyou. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Or probably he's not chuunibyou after all, but keep that for another question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being the earlier anime (&lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt; was aired in 2006 while &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt; was aired in 2012) it got me thinking about whether the word &quot;chuunibyou&quot; actually originated from this anime. Or probably it was not just as popular as now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44054">&lt;p&gt;No, the word "chuunibyou" was not coined by the anime &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt; (nor by &lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt;). The term is attested back to 1999. (For further reading, the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou" rel="noreferrer"&gt;TVTropes article&lt;/a&gt; linked in &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/44044/is-the-word-chuunibyou-originated-from-the-anime-chuuni#comment58985_44044"&gt;Aki Tanaka's comment&lt;/a&gt; seems good.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=%E4%B8%AD%E4%BA%8C%E7%97%85,%E4%B8%AD%E4%BA%8C%E7%97%85%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E6%81%8B%E3%81%8C%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Data from Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; seem to indicate that searches for this word were low but slowly rising until October 2012, when searches spiked (because that's when &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt; premiered). Search volume for "chuunibyou" has since fallen off, but is somewhat higher than it was just before October 2012, even after you subtract out searches specifically for &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt;. My point here is that in 2006 (unlike now), the word "chuunibyou" had very limited purchase and it is hence unsurprising that it would not be used in &lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;So Araragi jumps out of a portal and saves Tsubasa from the History Tiger while carrying the Kaii slaying sword...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought it was after traveling back to the present (Mayoi Jiangshi) but he just came back normally and he didn't even use the sword.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've watched up to Hitagi End and I don't see where that scene fits in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21439">&lt;p&gt;You didn't miss anything; the Second Season anime never shows us what happened to Koyomi during the time period of Tsubasa Tiger after the end of Shinobu Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the novels, though, there is a Third Season of stories which take place during the same timeframe as the Second Season. The Third Season hasn't been adapted to anime yet, although it may well be in the future, since they made Tsukimonogatari against my expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suruga Devil is chronologically the last story in the Monogatari series, but the Third Season explains what Ougi's deal is and shows us what was going on behind the scenes during the Second Season, including what happened to Koyomi after Shinobu Time. I haven't read the Third Season novels, but according to the Bakemonogatari wikia, the story Shinobu Mail from Owarimonogatari Volume 2 covers this period. It takes place between Shinobu Time (which was immediately after Mayoi Jiangshi, and also overlapped with Tsubasa Tiger) and Ougi Formula, the first story of Owarimonogatari. You can read a thorough summary of Shinobu Mail &lt;a href="http://bakemonogatari.wikia.com/wiki/Owarimonogatari#Shinobu_Mail" rel="nofollow"&gt;on the wikia&lt;/a&gt;; I'll just summarize how it bridges the gap between Shinobu Time and the end of Tsubasa Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In return for her help during Shinobu Time, Gaen Izuko asks Koyomi to help her deal with an ancient kaii which seems to have a connection to Shinobu. This is why the vampire hunter Episode was in town to meet Tsubasa on the street during Tsubasa Tiger: he was hired by Izuko to help with this job. Izuko also has Koyomi summon Suruga. Suruga meets Koyomi at Eikou Cram School. They have a confrontation with the ancient kaii, which ends when Kako sets fire to the building. Shinobu and Black Hanekawa arrived during Tsubasa Tiger just in time to see the building burning. Shinobu and Black Hanekawa fight a strange creature in the park, after which they get separated. Koyomi and Suruga meet up with Shinobu. It turns out that the ancient kaii in samurai armor is Shinobu's first servant, mentioned in Kizumonogatari. After a climactic confrontation with him, Koyomi sets off with Kokorowatari to save Tsubasa from Kako, leading to the end of Tsubasa Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the short answer is that Koyomi was off on a job for Izuko between Shinobu Time and the final scene of Tsubasa Tiger. He was beat up when he rescued Tsubasa because he'd just finished with another battle.&lt;/p&gt;

So far I know that color pigment to an energy move doesn't really matter and in most cases in DBZ it's a bit of a design trope to signify the uniqueness of that move to that character. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Black&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;Mira&lt;/code&gt;(from Dragon Ball XV the game) are the only two characters portrayed to have a dark kamehameha technique. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since the title is changed I was wondering if it uses something else other than ki. Perhaps dark god ki? Or demon ki? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Has there been any elaboration on the technique? Or is it just another trope like Freeza having a pink destructo disk? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="14083" Title="Who is this mystery girl with blue hair?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Captain Earth, there is a girl that appears only in two occasions during the series, when Daichi gets his Livlaster, and at the ending.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She is featured in the opening, so at first I confused her with Setsuna, but the hairstyle was different (huge giveaway they were not the same person).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So who is this ex-machina-lady?

Can anyone point another source to her bio?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14121">&lt;p&gt;The fact is, we don't have a clue from the series. Our best guess is the Livlaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason 1 - They were confirmed to be living things with a will, but we never really "met" them. We met the machines, but not them, which is odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason 2 - Her color style is the same as Daichi's Livlaster, so there is reasonable evidence to make the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason 3 - She was first seen when he got the Livlaster. She is only seen with Daichi during critical moments for him. So she and he are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next best option is Pitz, but we never gave a corresponding figure for the other squirrel. However, this is probably the second best theory based on the evidence. Following that theory is a new character (like a planetary gear) to intro into a season 2. We have no reason to suspect this, but hey, we don't know. Lastly is Daichi's mom. He lives with his uncle, his dad died, so we have a missing mom figure. Maybe there's some backstory?&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14126">&lt;p&gt;She is both Pitz and the Livlaster, both Pitz and the girl have the same eye shape and color and she appeared to Daichi to give him the Livlaster.

The girls didn't have fairies to protect them, so they could and often did get hurt. They also didn't have the sealing ritual or Mankai at first either, so in the early battles they had no way to kill a vertex; the best possible outcome was to drive it off without any of them sustaining any serious injuries, but they weren't always that lucky. Gin died protecting the other two girls after they had both been injured in a battle, but for the full story (which is both heroic and sad) you really should read the light novel - it's a good book, and answers several questions that were left open by the anime. All of the chapters have been fan-translated into English and posted online.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="7761" Title="Who was King Bradley supposed to be?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Fullmetal Alchemist (2003 anime series) Fuhrer Bradley/King Bradley is a homunculus and is head of the military in Central. They say the Homunculi are created when an alchemist attempts human transmutation, which always fails and from those failures, a homunculus is created and is born to look like whoever they were suppose to be bought back as.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;e.g. Alphonse and Ed tried to resurrect Trisha, their mother, and end up failing. Years later they run into her but she is known as Miss Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't remember how I know that Homunculi are suppose to look like what they were supposed to be resurrected as but what was King Bradley supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7762">&lt;p&gt;I'll take my shot at an answer. In the 2003 continuity, homunculi are created when alchemists attempt human transmutation, as you stated earlier. This more or less explains the origins of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrath, who was created by Izumi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sloth, who, as you stated, was created by the Elric brothers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy, who was Hohenheim's son&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lust, who was created by Scar's brother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this "rule" and the examples in the anime, it's at the very least implied that the resulting homunculus from a human transmutation will resemble, at least to a degree, the original intended result of the transmutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't recall the series explaining the origins of Gluttony, Greed, or Pride, though according to the fan-made Fullmetal Alchemist Wiki, they were all created by Dante. In &lt;a href="http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Gluttony" rel="nofollow"&gt;the case of Gluttony&lt;/a&gt;, this seems to have been done for the purpose of creating philosopher's stones, at least according to the FMA Wiki (which may or may not be a reliable source). In the case of Pride, it would make sense to a degree for the homunculus to have been created as a means to control the government for Dante's purposes, but it seems that neither the purpose of creating Pride nor his origins are ever explicitly stated in the 2003 series.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="11568">&lt;p&gt;From what I know is.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrath was Izumi's child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sloth was Ed and Al's mom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy was Hohenheim's son&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed from what I can tell was Dante's second lover after Hohenheim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lust was Scar's brother's wife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as Gluttony and Pride, I think Dante made them just to help her to obtain the philosophers stone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gluttony can create red stones (incomplete philosophers stones) which are needed to make a complete philosophers stone and to keep the homunculi alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride infiltrates the military and start wars, which helps with the collecting of mass amounts of souls, and in pushing people to create a philosophers stones in self defense.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="4071" Title="How did Nunnally and Sayoko survive the FLEIJA?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The sheer action of the FLEIJA leaves behind a very neat crater and turns matter in its radius into a vacuum (airborne units tend to get blown into the blast center). How did Nunnally and Sayoko survive that?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4313">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://animehistory.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/theory-of-a-live-girl-code-geass-spoilers-inside/"&gt;This blogpost&lt;/a&gt; adequately explains how she could have survived.
I also do not believe there was as much of a vacuum because at that point in time the FLEIJAs still had a limiter. It was not until the destruction of the Capital city of Pendragon that the limiters were removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the summary of the link: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After Sayoko rescued Kallen she went on ahead to find Nunnally and to try and Rendevouz with Rolo and found the ship Nunally was on. Around the same time the Gefjun disturbers were disabled and Nunnally&#8217;s ship left with Sayoko and her men aboard.  She never passed Rolo because he hadn&#8217;t even reached the hangar yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Eight minutes later Rohmeyer is on a decoy ship with KF&#8217;s to make it look like the governor general is aboard and Rolo walks in to find the ship, assuming reasonably that Nunally is on it he commandeers a KF to try and blow up the ship and kill her.  Meanwhile Sayoko barges in on Nunnally in the ship she&#8217;s really on and Rohmeyer doesn&#8217;t respond at all because she&#8217;s actually on the decoy back in the hangar.  Nunnally&#8217;s ship is probably just outside the area by this point.  When the bomb goes off Rohmeyer is caught in it in her decoy ship and goes up in a ball of flames.  Rolo has run away once he thinks he knows what&#8217;s going on with Fleija (whatever it&#8217;s called) and somehow made it to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;How? I&#8217;m not sure as that thing had a pretty big blast radius.  So when he reports to Rolo he talks about the ship Rohmeyer is on and really isn&#8217;t lying when he says Nunnally is dead, because he honestly thinks she is.  In reality I think she&#8217;s okay and with Sayoko elsewhere.  Though that elsewhere might be in Schneizel&#8217;s clutches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9767">&lt;p&gt;I believe that the FLEIJA that was used by Suzaku was not as powerful as the ones used by Prince Shnizle because Shnizle removed the limiter. Now if I can remember correctly Nunnally and Sayoko were underground and just out of the blast radius. Now how Nunnally, Sayoko and Gilford disappeared is uncertain. Without the power I believe that the outer blast radius is just a light show, and pulls then pushes out. I believe it threw them in some random direction out of sight. Stupid I know, but that's all I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9814">&lt;p&gt;Do you have anything to back this up from Code Geass (or any related materials) itself? &#8211;  Maroon 2 days ago &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact I do. In Season 2 Episode 23 Floyd, Miss Cecile, and Nina talk about the FLEIJA that destroyed the Capital Pendragon, and Miss Cecile points out that the FLEIJA that Shnizal used that destroyed the Capital Pendragon was more 10x the destruction range than the one Suzaku use. Nina realized that he removed both the effect range and detination time limiter. These FLEIJA's Shnizle uses go critical when they are fired as he mentions when Lelouch orders his men to charge at the FLEIJA's. Now the FLEIJA's do pull things into the center of the blast because in the battle of Lelouch and Shnizal, Shnizal fired a FLEIJA and everything was pulled into the center. You may say that it was Lelouches order to charge at the FLEIJA and he did but if you see the environment like the oceans this shows things get pulled into the center of the blast. I believe FLEIJA's do not explode, but implode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to watch the final episodes of Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebelion R2 go to animefreak.tv and watch Episodes 23-25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S this does not explain everything about the FLEIJA's but it gave me enough to reach my conclusions&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="47948" Title="Why MAL (MyAnimeList) is putting light novel and comic together?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I live in Hong Kong, and at least from my observation, light novels and comics are quite different things in Asia. However it seems that on sites like MAL, which is not of the Asian origin, they categorize light novels and comics as one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are light novel and comic seen as similar things in English speaking area? Or is there any special reason for services such as MAL to decide light novel and comic should fall under the same type?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that this site is named &quot;Anime &amp;amp; Manga&quot;, but also contains a light-novel-production tag. Hence the same categorization seems to happen here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47951">&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say comics and light novels are the same thing. 
To be even more precise, I think there's even a big difference between Comics and Manga &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/13257/1458"&gt;but more about that can be read over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction can also be found strongly in the readers. Not all light novel readers like manga, and vice versa. This being the case in both Asian and Western cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on services such as MAL and A&amp;amp;M, it does make sense to throw them under the same category. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A&amp;amp;M aims to be a Q&amp;amp;A platform focused on a fandom, which commonly identifies themselves under the terms 'anime and manga' fans. However, the people that are part of this fandom don't limit themselves to 1 specific medium, as some stories may differ/extend through out Visual novels, light novels, manga and anime/movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also leads to questions about Visual novels, light novels, and the likes. Which is also the reason we have a tag for &lt;a href="/questions/tagged/light-novel-production" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &amp;#39;light-novel-production&amp;#39;" rel="tag"&gt;light-novel-production&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take from a MAL perspective, you want to keep track of what you have watched/read, whether this is a light novel, or a manga/comic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So TL;DR, this form of categorization is mostly for convenience, and reaching a larger chunk of a/the fandom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The author of the manga is taking a break after a two-chapter release. (Which basically means that the author already did this weeks job last week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author is on vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author is on an unpaid leave due to reasons of his concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author is sick and cannot work due to that. (Pretty much calling in sick, in layman terms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other reasons a normal person may not be able to work at a job all also apply here. If by chance there is a public holiday but a chapter still comes out, chances are the author prepared the chapter beforehand, and is enjoying the holiday like everyone else, although it appears that he was "working" that week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As pointed out by Miharu in the comments below, there also might be a rare situation where a manga which is based on a currently airing anime has caught up to the anime and therefore might take a break to let the anime progress a little further. (Personally I haven't seen this phenomenon though.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9484">&lt;p&gt;The most typical reason is a scheduled vacation. Out of four weeks the year, Japan celebrates major holidays and festivities. Many schools take the week off as a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of you question is the holiday called "Golden Week." These are the only times that the mangaka can take a scheduled break without taking a hiatus (e.g., taking off the next issue). They called preceding issue (before the break) is a "double issue." Now you may think that a double issue means that since the magazine is meant for a 2-week period, the contents are doubles. That's not the case here. What's implied is that there will be no Weekly Shonen Jump issue in the following week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Weekly Shonen Jump the last week of December (end of the year; Christmas), 2nd week of January (New Years holiday), first week of May ("Golden Week," a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_%28Japan%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of holidays), second week of August (Obon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for series animated by the same studio to contain jokes or references to other series. It can provide a great joke for those who have seen the referenced series (causing them to call out "I know what that's from!" just like you have), but for heavier references it might be a bit of an advertisement as well.&lt;/p&gt;

There are already some other people there piloting mecha. The boy forms some kind of connection with a mecha that is smaller than the rest, and also somewhat feminine-looking. At least, it seemed to have high heels on its feet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure but I think I watched it the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, what I remember is that, that boy also gets another, big yellow robot.

Body="&lt;p&gt;On the last two episodes of &lt;em&gt;Freezing Vibration&lt;/em&gt; (2nd season of &lt;em&gt;Freezing&lt;/em&gt;), we could see Kazuya, Rana, and Satellizer fighting Chevalier's Pandora and Student Council President Chiffon Fairchild.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this fight, although set as 2 against 1, Satellizer and Rana were badly wounded and beaten.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was wondering, Kazuya was there and he has this powerful Freezing field he can generate on his own. So why did Kazuya not use his freezing ability against Chiffon?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though fighting against a &quot;True&quot; Pandora, two Pandoras working together with activated stigmata and a very powerful Freezing can mean a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He used it in other episodes when he was fighting beside Satellizer against other tough pandoras. So why didn't he use it against Chiffon?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29947">&lt;p&gt;First of all, Kazuya doesn't know how to control his powers. This can be seen every time he uses them. It is always in the last second and only if somebody is in danger, especially Bridgette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this fight, he is unable to use it, because he does not want to hurt Chiffon. Also he sees that Rana and Bridgette have no chance of winning any way. Rana's arms were ripped off in a second and after she transformed and beat up Chiffon, Chiffon just stands up as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Also, Kazuya's powers are needed a bit later and he tends to overexert himself. So it would be impossible to solve the problems which arise later.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="5693" Title="How does Teshigawara create the recording" Body="&lt;p&gt;After the summer field trip, Teshigawara and Mochizuki re-record Matsunaga's message about how to stop the Calamity after it's started - with an emphasis on the actions being discussed, so that no one regrets the decision, and also to prevent the same insanity that took over the entire class during the summer trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, that happened after the Extra had been killed. It was revealed earlier, from Matsunaga's account of killing the Extra, that only the person responsible for the Extra's death will remember it for a short while. When Sakakibara showed everyone the class photos that were taken when they arrived, no one sees or even knows of the Extra which Sakakibara and Mei can see and remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Sakakibara remembers Reiko because he was the one who killed her after learning that she was the Extra.  Mei remembers, because not only was she there and about to do the killing herself, but as she also revealed, she remembers seeing Reiko die. Her &quot;false eye&quot; could also contribute to her remembering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, since only Sakakibara and Mei remember the Extra, how do Teshigawara and Mochizuki remember that it was the death of the Extra that stopped the Calamity? since it was once that killing the Extra stopped the Calamity (so it wasn't proven that there was a link)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6263">&lt;p&gt;The loss of memory applies to the existence of the extra person. Teshigawara and Mochizuki forgot about Reiko's existence, but they didn't forget the &lt;strong&gt;fact&lt;/strong&gt; that they were working alongside Sakakibara and Mei to repel the curse looking for the extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since everyone realised that the curse stopped (because people stopped dying), they should have concluded that the Extra died, whoever that was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's just reasonable that, after Sakakibara and Mei killed Reiko, they explained the situation to Teshigawara and Mochizuki, who of course believed them despite the lack of memory. At this point, it wouldn't be surprising that Teshigawara would be capable of making a recording with the warning.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="37592" Title="How did Madara fake his death during his battle with Hashirama?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Did Madara use Izanagi or Izanami and if yes then how did he have two Rinnegans? If someone uses Izanagi their sharingan gets destroyed right? If he used Izanagi then he should have only one sharingan left and then that evolved into Rinnengan. How does he have two Rinnengans?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="37594">&lt;h2&gt;Spoiler alert for if you haven't finished the manga or anime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Madara used the Izanagi to cheat death (just like I said in the comment section). The second part that I said was wrong. When he was fighting Hashirama he bit off a part of his (Hashirama's) arm, then after his "death" he vomited up the piece of flesh and implanted it into his wounds, which let him activate the Rinnegan (in both eyes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should remember that Hashirama is Ashura's reincarnation and Madara is Indra's (Ashura and Indra are The Sage of Six Paths' children), which is the reason why he was able to awaken it (Rinnegan) in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Rinnegan can typically be awakened by gaining Hagoromo's chakra either by reproducing it from combining the chakra of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, or by directly receiving chakra from Hagoromo himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Madara's Sharingan did not become Rinnegan until decades later, at the end of his natural lifespan; this also seemingly &lt;strong&gt;restored the eyesight lost from his use of Izanagi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he didn't awaken the it right away. (The other part of your question is also answered above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Mangeky&#333; Sharingan's usage and activity place a great strain on the user themselves, wearing at the user's body and causing deterioration to their vision until eventually over-usage leaves them blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is case with Izanagi.
Izanagi in same way takes away ordinary mangekyo Sharingan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their vision can be restored by receiving the transplanted Mangeky&#333; of an Uchiha with strong blood ties &#8212; ideally a sibling &#8212; thus awakening so-called&#160;Eternal Mangeky&#333; Sharingan. The Eternal Mangeky&#333; merge the designs of the transplanter and the transplantee's original Mangeky&#333;.
  Their Mangeky&#333;-based abilities are made stronger and they ** no longer suffer any negative side-effects from the usage**. According to&#160;Madara, the Eternal Mangeky&#333; Sharingan is proof an Uchiha continues to seek something despite experiencing great losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Madara had eternal mangekyo Sharingan which he never after Izanagi.
Thus, he could have Rinnegan in both his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39380">&lt;p&gt;He sealed the Izanagi in his eye before the battle meaning that if he died it would activate and bring him back, so in theory he could have used his old Sharingan before he gained the eternal mangekyo, after all we saw Danzo do that having a sharingan in his arm to sacrifice rather than the one he had in his head. So why can't madara have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I just began watching Suisei no Garugantia and didn't understand why there is that unexplained (at least so far) war against the Hideauze aliens. Who attacked first, and for what reason?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4060">&lt;p&gt;If you just began watching the series, this answer will be a huge spoiler for you. The information here is from episode 9, so I'd advise you to wait for the episode before reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In episode 9, Ledo got hold of some information from the past in which he learnt about the origins of both the Hideauze and the war between them and mankind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers from episode 9 from here onward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Earth's fifth ice age, a group of humans underwent heavy genetic modifications, in order to adapt themselves to space environment, so that they could migrate from Earth. These people were called the Evolvers. The human Evolvers are what became the Hideauze.&lt;br&gt;
There were countries that stood by the Evolvers, and countries that stood against them (the Continental Union). The opposition movement against the Evolvers opened fire against them. From there things escalated into a war between "regular" humans and Hideauze (genetically modified humans), because they both wanted to flee from Earth (using a portal being built by the Continental Union), and saw each other as a threat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Basically, "regular" humans attacked first, because they saw the genetic modifications the Evolvers underwent as a sort of blasphemy (and were, most likely, afraid of them). However, the war only got to what it is now because the Hideauze saw the portal being built as a threat to them (because they'd be stranded on Earth), and decided to take preemptive action against "regular" humans.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a set of pics from episode 9 (click it to enlarge):&lt;br&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="28266" Title="About Lelouch and Nunnally during and soon after the invasion of Japan" Body="&lt;p&gt;From what I remember: Lelouch and Nunnally were given as hostages to Japan. Britannia invades Japan. Lelouch and Nunnally somehow live.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why exactly are they alive and not announced dead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought the whole point of taking or giving hostages is to ensure a certain agreement. When Britannia invaded Japan, it seems whatever agreement Britannia and Japan had was breached so why didn't Genbu or whoever execute Lelouch and Nunnally? Is it that someone tried but failed to do so?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if for some reason the relevant legitimate or de facto authorities of Japan didn't want to execute Lelouch and Nunnally (pity, morality, attempt at using them as double agents or whatever), why didn't Lelouch or someone decide to have his and Nunnally's (fake) deaths made known rather than making Clovis, Euphemia, Cornelia, et al merely presume or suspect their deaths?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Could be remembering the series wrong, but it seems like they guessed Lelouch and Nunnally were dead rather than, say, found out from Japanese news. If I were one of them, I would find it suspicious that the Japanese authorities didn't execute or announce that they executed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28272">&lt;p&gt;Lelouch and Nunnally being sent to Japan as Hostages was itself another ploy. In Season 2 when Charles is explaining everything to Lelouch when they are trapped in the Sword of Akasha he revealed that he sent them away to protect them for V.V who had already murdered Marianne. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also at the start of the series we see C.C watching a young Lelouch and Suzaku probably before the war so given the connection Marianne had with C.C during the series it's possible C.C (before being captured) was sent by Marianne to look out for her children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior the start of the War Britannia haddn't fully developed their Knightmares which was one of the key pieces of technology which gave Britannia an edge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Lelouch_vi_Britannia#Character_Outline" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lelouch vi Britannia - Character Outline (2nd Paragraph)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means executing them would have no merit. remember also that Lelouch had forfeited his claim to the Throne and before doing this the background chatter by the Nobles talked about them being lucky if Nunnally could be married off for political gain in her condition. their value as hostages were already much lower and Japan's main bargaining chip was their Sakuradite which, now with their Knightmares, Britannia could take by force and stop the other super powers from getting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also i would think Suzaku and Todoh would have done something to save them if someone got the idea to punish Britannia by executing them (and i suspect at the start of the series were we see Lelouch vow to destroy Britannia it was Todoh who we see at the fire).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for making Lelouch's and Nunnally's deaths known to be false this would probably just insult Britannia. the first thing that would be done if this happened was to denounce Japan's claims and because most Britannians look down on foreigners chances are that Charles would claim that Lelouch and Nunnally were impostors withother probably voicing their disgust that the Japanese have the audacity to use foreign commoners to pose as members of the Imperial Family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets not forget that the heirs to the throne were fighting one another, while there are some would would want to protect Lelouch and Nunnally there are others who would use the war as a cover to kill them permanently removing them from the line of succession. weather the Japanese knew is or not doesn't matter as Lelouch would be opposed to it because it would be putting Nunnally in greater danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobi couldn't attack and defend at the same time with Kamui. 
His strategy was to allow his opponent to attack, but by using Kamui, the attack would fly straight through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5PuHzMLLf4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""&gt;
If Minato didn't have the teleportation, Tobi would have won.
Tobi's strategy is actually quite interesting, as he didn't use the kamui in the way that you thought that he would. I think that this is Obito's way of doing. He could use the Kamui in that way but chooses not to, because his strategy is more tactical. &lt;/p&gt;

Why does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="14325">&lt;p&gt;My answer is based off of what I know from reading "Hey Answerman" every once in a while, but I think it should be a good enough guess of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Production Committee for Log Horizon decided to adapt the novels into an anime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They bought 25 weeks worth of a time slot because they were pretty confident that it would be more successful than a typical 13 week anime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They contracted an animation studio to animate it (Satelight). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The anime aired and it had a good response with ratings and DVD sales. (And, more importantly, Light Novel sales.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Production Committee thought "Hey, the first series turned a profit and there is a demand for more, lets make a second series"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Production Committee checks with Satelight and decides not to use them again because they were either too expensive or they had already contracted to animate another anime during the proposed season (scheduling conflicts). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Production Committee finds some other animation studio (Studio Deen) that doesn't currently have plans for that season and goes with them because its better to do a second series now while the fan interest is high than to wait until Satelight is available.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests the old man might've manipulated the young man into believing he was a fragile, innocent elderly person when he wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="32059">&lt;p&gt;In the main series &lt;em&gt;Death Parade&lt;/em&gt;, Decim had spoken on more than one occasion (episodes 7 and 10) of his respect for people who had lived their lives to the fullest (&#29983;&#12434;&#20840;&#12358;&#12375;&#12383;&#20154;&#38291;&#12434;&#23562;&#25964;&#12377;&#12427;). It was obvious that Decim considered the young man to be one such person, but what about the old man? The old man cited the reason he must win and leave that place as being&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've already decided that I'll eat one [pickle] right before I die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that was exactly what he was last seen doing right before his death. Compare that to the young man's motivation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to get out of here and apologize to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the young man wanted to do something differently with his life. What good would there be by sending the old man to be reincarnated, if a large chunk of his life could be summarized in 4 seconds in a boring GIF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGrMl.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGrMl.gif" alt="Old man&amp;#39;s life in 4 seconds"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was the thrill of being able to beat people up again, the "been a vegetable for the past few years" fraud, &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3334/8486"&gt;the fishy conversation&lt;/a&gt; between the old man and Decim, the hiss at 22 minutes and 26 seconds, and the evil grin &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/31630/8486"&gt;as mentioned by Quill&lt;/a&gt;. Too many dark things about the old man that were only known to Decim.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the dogfight between Gilgamesh and Berserker, Gilgamesh rides a golden fighter plane that is capable of hovering and flying at great speeds, supposedly by harnessing some &quot;strange green power&quot; (see the opening wings and glow when Gilgamesh prepares to dodge Berkserker's approach). The Gate of Babylon is supposed to contain Gilgamesh's treasures of his time, so how did such a futuristic contraption come into his possession?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="334">&lt;p&gt;This "airplane" is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana"&gt;Vimana&lt;/a&gt;. It is recorded in several epic Hindu texts, including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. In fact, in the original Sanskrit works, there is more than one vimana, but in any case it is a flying contraption that gods would ride. There is no record of them in Babylonian literature as far as I know, but of course Gilgamesh owns the prototypes for all of the technology that appeared in later cultures, which presumably includes this.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8358">&lt;p&gt;There are several examples of what would seem like futuristic technology in ancient cultures like the Egyptians and Babylonians. In temple of Seti I there are hyroglyphics that depict blimps and helicopters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/18GF4.jpg" alt="Temple of Seti hyroglyphics"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_hieroglyphs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Image Source - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vimana is another example of this. Also Ea is a construct "not of this world" and is an Anti - World Noble Phantasm that defies the analysis of Unlimited Bladeworks despite not being a Divine Holy Relic like Excalibur. This suggest that Vimana and Ea are of Alien Origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may come into play later as Fate is part of the Nasu-verse and we know they use the many worlds interpretation of time and space, adding or hinting at alien worlds to this is not a stretch for them.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37713">&lt;p&gt;Basically, because Gilgamesh was the very first king, every treasure was claimed by him, including everything made by Man. Even after he died, things than Mankind dreamed up afterwards were claimed by him. That or the power of magic back then meant that his kingdom was able to make magical things equal or greater to modern inventions. It is also is that as the very first Hero, he must have the prototype to every weapon or item used by later heroes. The only things Gate of Babylon doesn't contain is anything made with new concepts by a new human race, or items made by extraterrestials or with extraterrestial knowledge. In Fate/Extra, he even has a spaceship able to move at the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article I got this all from is worded a little confusingly, but I think it is that if Mankind has or will make something, then as the first King and Hero, he already has it in his vault. So either the Vimana is a magical airship, or it's based on a ship Mankind will make.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="48474" Title="What did Makie talk about with the worker in harbor?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a question about scene from 5th Episode of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio Ars Nova anime TV series. (at about 1:20)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was depicted that Osakabe Makie was talking with a harbor employee with an assistance of military soldier.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Chihaya Gunzou said to Iona when noticied her on monitor:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;That girl... Do you remember her?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My question is: &lt;strong&gt;What was she doing there?&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;What was she talking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I assume that &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All works on Vibration Warhead were done and they did not need any advises from her.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;She didn't yet realize that her guests were of &lt;em&gt;Fog&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48561">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I did broader research (read the manga version). Based on this, I would like to give a try to answer my own question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I do understand that manga and anime of &lt;em&gt;Arpegio of Blue Steel&lt;/em&gt; is completely different story but some concepts overlap and there is a possibility that manga-based explanation would work for anime too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In manga, Osakabe Tojurou gave Makie false memories about her past and her family. According to them, Makie had a grandpa, whom was deeply attached emotionally to. Tojurou used the opportunity that I-401 departed from Yokosuka port (2 years before original plot) and tuned the false memories that her grandpa wend aboard and did never return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Makie heard somehow that I-401 arrived back in the port and planned escape from mansion in order &lt;strong&gt;to see her grandpa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact that can help confirm the hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She appeared near the same Hangars when found Kirishima's core and Haruna. It was on her way to Yokosuka port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact that can help deny the hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In manga, her stuffed bear named Yotarou was gift given by grandpa. In anime we can see photos that she received it from Tojurou himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In episode &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;, you (the viewer) learn that the class is ignoring Misaki as part of a "countermeasure" to ward off the calamity that affects class 3-3 (which is what causes all the paranormal phenomena you see in episodes 1-4, e.g. the girl nearly getting crushed by the falling glass pane; the nurse in the crashing elevator; etc). The basic idea is that the class has one more person than it should (you find out why in episode &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;, I believe), and so by pretending that one of the people in the class doesn't exist, they bring the number of people in the class down to the correct number. &lt;/p&gt;

The author, Barasui, was on hiatus &lt;em&gt;due to a sudden illness on 2015-08-29&lt;/em&gt;, but the rest of hiatuses were due to "the author's circumstance" until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the serialization on &lt;em&gt;Monthly Dengeki Daioh&lt;/em&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengeki_Daioh#In_Dengeki_Daioh" rel="noreferrer"&gt;English Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the title is still on-going. It's hinted clearer on the &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%88%E5%88%8A%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E9%9B%BB%E6%92%83%E5%A4%A7%E7%8E%8B#.E9.9B.91.E8.AA.8C.E3.82.AA.E3.83.AA.E3.82.B8.E3.83.8A.E3.83.AB" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Japanese counterpart&lt;/a&gt; since it's included in the &#29694;&#22312;&#36899;&#36617;&#20013;&#12398;&#20316;&#21697; (currently serialized title) category instead of &#20241;&#36617;&#20013; (on hiatus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was on hiatus from edition &lt;em&gt;2009-5&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;2010-2&lt;/em&gt; (10 months)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if he did publish it, it was only an average of 5-6 pages including the cover page. However, the illustration was so detailed and each chapter could stand alone, making it a short-story manga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In edition &lt;em&gt;2015-12&lt;/em&gt;, he only published 8 pages compared to his previous usual 18 pages (also, compared to &lt;em&gt;Yotsuba to!&lt;/em&gt;'s 28 pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the title itself, according to &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8B%BA%E3%81%BE%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8D#.E5.8D.98.E8.A1.8C.E6.9C.AC" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Japanese Wikipeda&lt;/a&gt; about the published date of the &lt;em&gt;tankobon&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="5251" Title="Who created the Uchiha's Clan's stone tablet in the Naka Shrine?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Deciphering the Uchiha's stone tablet, located in the Naka Shrine, requires the Mangekyou Sharingan or Rinnegan. However does the creation of the tablet require a Mangekyou and Rinnegan?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rikudou Sennin had the Rinnegan and one of his sons who inherited his eye-techniques as the Mangekyou Sharingan.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What type of person was capable of creating this tablet?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5260">&lt;p&gt;Kishi never explicitly stated in the manga that Rikudou Sennin created the tablet, however we can make an educated guess that he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To read the entire Uchiha tablet, the Rinnegan is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Madara is stated to be the second Sage of the Six Paths. (This should mean no one else had the Rinnegan inbetween Rikudou Sennin and Madara.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tablet had an extensive list of things, like the Moon Eye plan, how to obtain Mangekyou Sharingan, how to obtain the Rinnegan, and the history of the God Tree with Kaguya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaguya could not have written the tablet because most of the tablet's info pertain to Rikudou Sennin's era, where he had the Rinnegan and was the Juubi Jinchuriki. And since Kaguya isn't considered to be a Sage of Six paths, we can assume she doesn't have the Rinnegan either. We can also assume that a Rinnegan user must have written the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, Rikudou and Madara are the only two candidates left, but Madara uses the tablet to learn about the history of Shinobi, so Rikudou is the only one who could have written the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Additionally, Tobi stated the Sage of Six paths created the tablet here (bottom panels).&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="5862" Title="Where do the movies fit within there series timeline?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I have all three seasons of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha and the two movies. I am wondering where the movies occur chronologically within in the series. So I can watch them in the proper order.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5863">&lt;p&gt;The first two Nanoha movies are retellings of the first and second seasons of the anime respectively. That is to say that "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st" covers the same story as the original "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha" and "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's" covers the same part of the story as "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's". The not-yet-aired third movie is supposedly going to be an original story which will be set between A's and StrikerS on the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some minor differences between the anime and the movies. Technically, the movies form their own continuity. However, these differences are all minor as far as I remember. With that in mind, there are many possible orders to watch the series, and so long as you respect the internal chronology any viewing order seems reasonable. If you want to watch all the anime in chronological order by release date (which is what I'd personally recommend), it would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5879">&lt;p&gt;In addition to the excellent response provided by Logan M, these are the anime and manga series in a chronological order. The &lt;em&gt;Vivid&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Force&lt;/em&gt; manga series continue the story from the anime, while the other manga entries are nothing more than additional background content for the die-hard fan &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha MOVIE 1st THE COMICS (Manga)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's (Manga)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS THE COMICS (Manga)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid (Manga)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Force (Manga)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do note that the movies are alternate retellings that are not 100% story-wise compatible with the original series. In &lt;strong&gt;StrikerS&lt;/strong&gt; there are a number of background references to story from A's which has been scrapped in the movie retelling. I would recommend going through the original series (Nanoha, A's and StrikerS) prior to watching the movie retelling and/or reading the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I have watched HxH 2011 around 1 year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still wonder how's the concept of aura in HxH? How many types of aura and what kind of each speciality?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;e.g. Enhancer, Manipulator, Specialist, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can someone explain it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="39100">&lt;p&gt;I too watched HxH twice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aura concept is basically body energy (Nen) . Every person has different type of attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you saw  Naruto, there is also a concept where their chakra type is decided. Just the same as here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONE PiECE - Haki is used to defend, observe, fight &amp;amp; objects can be affected too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancers is the most powerful because they can use all the  Nen (ten, zetsu, ren, hatsu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjurers must &amp;amp; should use medium like phone, chains &amp;amp; puppets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialists are rare like genetics &amp;amp; other special attributes are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transmuters can change their aura type like Hisoka's Bungee Gum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulators manipulate things/humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emitters are also enhancers but difference is noticeably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Nen" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;'s a link for you to check out every detail.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39103">&lt;p&gt;The concept of Nen in HxH is comparable to Aura, Chakra, Haki, Mana, Magic, etc. from different series. It directly translates to Mind Energy apparently. In this series, it is life energy of the wielder who can manipulate it in different ways.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can obtain Nen abilities by being exposed to Nen.  Otherwise it takes years of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic Nen can be used by any type of Nen user.  These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ten - put aura around body rather than let it leak out of the body. also protects from other's aura&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zetsu - stop flow of aura (make yourself less detectable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ren - generate a large amount of aura around oneself for offense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hatsu - manifest aura to have special effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other abilities similar the the above which most users can learn to perform but are not "typed": Gyo, In, En, Shu, Ko, Ken, and Ryu are the examples so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very special users are known as geniuses and learned to use their Nen abilities without mastering the above.  The main examples are the Apraiser and the Fortuneteller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form a user's Hatsu takes is controlled by that user.  While in theory any user can master a skill from any of the 5 basic types, they tend to have an affinity for one type and can master it much easier.  Unlike other series, the Nen type is about how you move your aura and not elemental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjurors&lt;/strong&gt; can turn their Nen into physical objects.  They often has special properties. (summon chains for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmutors&lt;/strong&gt; can change the properties of their Nen and then manipulate that. (turn Nen into electricity and vice versa for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancers&lt;/strong&gt; apply their Nen to themselves to enhance their own physical abilities. (punch hard for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emitters&lt;/strong&gt; push their Nen into projectiles of into other people causing special properties. Sometimes the Nen takes physical shapes such a gorillas, energy balls, mascots, or fists but are still composed of Nen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulators&lt;/strong&gt;, finally, put their Nen into other objects and then manipulate that Nen to manipulate that object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are grouped so the most similar are near each other.  As Conjuration requires turning you Nen into something else, they find it easier to do Transmutor skills then Manipulator skills, for instance.  Enhancers find it much more difficult to do complex manipulation of Nen in other objects than just emit it as a projectile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialists&lt;/strong&gt; are special. Their Nen abilities cannot be described as any of the above and are rare.  No other group can learn a Specialist's ability, though a Conjuror or a Manipulator is more likely to become one than any other group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, very specific Nen abilites are somehow much more powerful than more general use abilities.  Putting restictings on its use, therefore, such as a ritual, target restictions, or delayed activation can make the Nen ability far more powerful.  For this reason, alot of power Nen abilities have complicated rules which must be followed.  Kuripika can only use some abilities on spiders. Gon's attacks have a long charging time and a chant. Chollo has several specific conditions which must be met before he can use his main ability.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39106">&lt;p&gt;@Kaine does a great job at summarizing the basic concept of Nen. I think they missed a few things though. So this anwer just supplements their excellent answer so read ONLY AFTER the first one. I also refer to various links to sources where you can read, if want in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly,&lt;/strong&gt; the Nen Chart that shows compatibility between Nen Types,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Xz0x.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Xz0x.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While talking about Nen, its impossible not to mention this chart. It explains why Enhancers can use Emission or Transmutation more easily then Manipulation or Conjuration. Ex: Gon's Rock-Paper-Scissors are kind of Enhancer, Emmitter and Transmutation attacks. Read more here : Source: &lt;a href="http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Nen#Nen_and_Individuality" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Nen And Individuality - Wikia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are numerical approximations to indicate just exactly how efficient one would be at using aura abilities that one is not born into. Starting at one's own aura type, one has the potential to be 100% efficient at using abilities based in that category alone. Then looking at the category chart, one has the potential to be 80% efficient at using aura types adjacent to one's primary type, 40% efficient at the opposite or farthest category, and 60% efficient in the two remaining categories. Specialization is typically unusable for non-Specialists because it is impossible to partially use; one either can or cannot use Specialist abilities. However, Conjurers and Manipulators have 1% efficiency potential of becoming Specialists due to being adjacent to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly,&lt;/strong&gt; How to find the Nen Nature for an individual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular and surefire is called the Water Divination Test. Put a Leaf atop a cup full of water and perform &lt;em&gt;Ren&lt;/em&gt; by putting your hands around the water and voila you know your Nen Type. (Kinda like the Chakra Paper from Naruto).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the volume of the water changes, the user is an Enhancer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the taste of the water changes, the user is a Transmuter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If impurities appear in the water, the user is a Conjurer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the color of the water changes, the user is an Emitter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the leaf moves on the water's surface, the user is a Manipulator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a completely different change appears, the user is a Specialist. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hisoka also has a Nen Personality test which is funny but obviously not a surefire way of finding out the Nen Type of individual. But it reveals a lot about the Main Characters personality types since they usually fit the mould.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancers&lt;/strong&gt; are determined and simple. Most of them never lie, hide nothing, and are very straightforward in their actions or in their thinking. Their words and actions are often dominated by their feelings. They are generally very selfish and focused on their goals. This is reflected in their Nen as enhancers typically rely on simple and uncomplicated Hatsu techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmuters&lt;/strong&gt; are whimsical and prone to deceit. Transmutation users have unique attitudes, and many are regarded as weirdos or tricksters. Often they put forth a facade while hiding the truer aspects of their personalities. Even when they don't hide their personalities they rarely reveal their true intentions. Many Transmuters rely on techniques that give unique and unpredictable properties to their Nen that reflects their personalities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emitters&lt;/strong&gt; are impatient, not detail-oriented, and quick to react in a volatile manner. Many of them are quick-tempered and hot-blooded. They resemble the Enhancers in building their impulsivity, but the difference with them, they probably tend to calm down and forget easier. Because of the nature of Emission, many Hatsu techniques created by emitters are primarily long range.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conjurers&lt;/strong&gt; are typically high-strung or overly serious and stoic. They are often on guard as to be cautious. They are very observant and logical, rarely falling into traps. Being able to analyze things calmly is the strength of Conjurers. Many of the items that conjurers create are often used by them in a very deliberate and practical, logical fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulators&lt;/strong&gt; are logical people who advance at their own pace. They are all for arguments and tend to want to keep their families and loved ones safe. On the other hand, when it comes to pursuing their own goals, they do not listen to what others might have to say about it. While manipulators often use techniques that allow them to control their opponents they also prefer to use an inanimate medium to control that can be used versatility (such as smoke or pieces of paper hardened with Shu).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialists&lt;/strong&gt; are individualistic and charismatic. They won't tell you anything important on them, and refrain from being close friends, but, because of their natural charisma that draws others, they are always surrounded by many people. Because Specialization is unique and can have many facets, most Specialists posses only one Hatsu technique. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;The Quantification of Nen&lt;/strong&gt;. There are various quantified versions of Nen, where you can directly predict the damage incurred as well predict the outcome in very simplistic cases. The article below discusses how much damage would an enhancer attack do to a Conjurer defense if both are using the basic and advance Nen techniques equally.

Body="&lt;p&gt;During &lt;em&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS&lt;/em&gt; it's revealed that between &lt;em&gt;StrikerS&lt;/em&gt; and the end of &lt;em&gt;A's&lt;/em&gt;, as Nanoha pushed her body too much without proper rest, she got injured during a mission with Vita to the point where she could have never walked/flown again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;During the battle in Saint's Cradle, when Vita comes across spider like Gadget Drones, she remembers seeing them during the mission which led to Nanoha being critically injured, and she lets out her anger on them because they were apparently responsible for almost ruining Nanoha's life.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am wondering, was the mission Vita and Nanoha did together where Nanoha was critically injured a Jail Scaglietti Investigation? If not, then what was the connection between Jail's Drones and that mission?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23780">&lt;p&gt;Before the events of &lt;em&gt;StrikerS&lt;/em&gt;, although Jail Scaglietti's existence was a secret known only to the top tiers of the TSAB, his activities were already known, albeit the identity of its perpetrator remained unknown. In fact, said activities are one of the main points Hayate used during his exposition when forming Riot Force 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can only deduce that Nanoha's incident happened in one encounter with Scaglietti's activities. Still, as there was no "Jail Scaglietti Investigation" back then, she must have been investigating a case of improper use of Lost Logia or usage of magical technology in an underdeveloped world (not specified, as far as I know)&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the rules of the death note says that if someone makes the shinigami eyes deal they will have excellent vision regardless of their previous vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rule in question, (listed under the Death Note Wiki as &quot;How to Use: XXI&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Those with the eye power of the god of death will have the eyesight&#10;  of over 3.6 in the human measurement, regardless of their original&#10;  eyesight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Could Light or any of the other characters in the series have cured a blind person with this rule? It seems to be a brilliant way to avoid suspicion and get a true ally to cure a blind person in exchange for half of their life and abuse their gratefulness to make them kill people for you, and who's going to suspect a blind man?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="33629">&lt;p&gt;From the wording of the rules of deathnote and the way the "eyes of Shinigami" are explained in the anime this scenario seems plausible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I've said many times in such questions this is meaningless speculation since either scenario is plausible and the rules of DN leave room for speculation. So other than just saying this scenario is possible and saying that some of our better fanfic writers picking this up as a possible plot point Idk what else to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to add to the "suspicion" on a blind man scenario. There are many ways this would be a bad idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suddenly a blind person is cured. Publicity, DN user is exposed. Someone else may have seen them together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not so easy to hide that you are not blind. Plenty of involuntary actions, such as dodging, moving hands etc give away the fact you're not blind. It would be much tougher for a blind person who has healed to hide these signs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on surface it may seem a good idea, but it has its own pitfalls, pros and cons just as another. Also the blind person will lose his sight the moment he gives up ownership of the DN. I would like to think that the KIRA will kill to get the Notebook back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the plot summary of the original &lt;em&gt;A Dog of Flanders&lt;/em&gt; from Wikipedia (&lt;strong&gt;emphasis&lt;/strong&gt; mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 19th century Belgium, &lt;strong&gt;a boy named Nello becomes an orphan&lt;/strong&gt; at the age of two when his mother dies in the Ardennes. &lt;strong&gt;His grandfather&lt;/strong&gt; Jehann Daas, who lives in a small village near the city of Antwerp, &lt;strong&gt;takes him in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;One day, &lt;strong&gt;Nello and Jehann Daas find a dog&lt;/strong&gt; who was almost beaten to death, and name him Patrasche. Due to the good care of Johaan Daas, the dog recovers, and from then on, Nello and Patrasche are inseparable. Since they are very poor, Nello has to help his grandfather by selling milk. Patrasche helps Nello pull their cart into town each morning.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Nello falls in love with Aloise, the daughter of a well-off man in the village named Nicholas Cogez. Nicholas doesn't want his daughter to have a poor sweetheart. Although Nello is illiterate, he is very talented in drawing. He enters a junior drawing contest in Antwerp, hoping to win the first prize, 200 francs per year. However, the jury selects somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Afterwards, he is accused of causing a fire by Nicholas (the fire occurred on his property) and &lt;strong&gt;his grandfather dies&lt;/strong&gt;. His life becomes even more desperate. Having no place to stay, Nello goes to the cathedral of Antwerp (see Rubens' The Elevation of the Cross), but he doesn't have enough money to enter. On the night of Christmas Eve, he and Patrasche go to Antwerp and, by chance, find the door to the church open. The next morning, the boy and his dog are found frozen to death in front of the triptych.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="43768" Title="Why is L hiding his face?" Body="&lt;p&gt;At the start of the series L hides behind a computer screen which draws criticism by members of the Japanese Police who were assigned to track down Kira. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;while in the context of the Kira Investigation in how the Death Note works and L's correct reasoning that Kira needed a face and name, hiding his face initially is a good defense against the Death Note.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When she was saying about how she met L, Naomi Misora said she worked under L by taking orders from a computer screen. this sounds just like how L was working at the start of the Kira Investigation and since the BB Murder Cases (which L comments is where he remember Naomi from when told she was missing) had nothing to do with the Death Note this means he was hiding his face not as a defense against Kira.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why was L hiding his face before taking on the Kira Investigation?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43769">&lt;p&gt;Presumably to both keep himself safe and give himself business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L has presumably put away a lot of people.  Probably incredibly smart people, given that it required someone at L's level to catch them.  It's easy to see at least one of these people holding a grudge or having friends who would want revenge.  Keeping his name and face secret offers him protection.  Good luck trying to kill a garbled voice coming from a computer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, remember other measures L used to keep safe.  Anyone wanting to contact L had to first go through Watari (who also used an alias).  This further cements the idea that L just wanted to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by keeping his identity secret, it allowed him to move freely.  He could live a normal life, possibly fit in at a college (say to try and trap Kira, for instance).  If he was publicly known, this would have been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all of this, he used other aliases for himself (also for safety and possibly for business reasons).  Remember Eraldo Coil, the number 2 detective in the world that the Yotsuba group hired to find out who L was?  That was L too.  It gave him a way to deflect someone looking into who L really was.  It also was a good way to generate business.  If you couldn't afford or get the interest of the almighty L, maybe the number 2 guy would be good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;I don't currently have access to the shows or wiki to be able to confirm some of this, but this is what I remember from having re-watched it somewhat recently.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don't really believe these are purely the animator having fun. Are there any other reasons? Like copyright or advertising? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;P.S. I am asking this for my essay, so please do think of it&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. image retrieved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ameblo.jp/pachuca33/entry-10678117022.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;P.P.P.S. feel free to leave any other thoughts about this &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="51019">&lt;p&gt;TV Tropes has an entire page dedicated to this phenomenon: &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bland-Name Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2jWLz.png" alt="obvious brand name parodies are obvious (source: Ouran High School Host Club)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing brand names is a fairly common phenomenon in media. As &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51011/why-oreimo-changed-the-actual-brand-name-in-akihabara#comment65979_51011"&gt;Dimitri mx mentions&lt;/a&gt;, this is probably because the studios want to avoid using &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark" rel="noreferrer"&gt;trademarks&lt;/a&gt; to play it safe. This is why parody names like "WcDonalds" and "EcDonalds" are so common in anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toradora&lt;/em&gt; casts a snarky lampshade on this practice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/animeoffbrands/comments/7q966u/sudohbucks/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RC7ZY.png" alt="&amp;quot;Sudoh-bucks&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Why hasn&amp;#39;t this place been sued yet?&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the anime actually does use the real names, if they get the product placement properly arranged behind the scenes. For example, this was the case with Pizza Hut in &lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;. (Hence the "Pizza Hut supports the Rebellion" memes.) For more detail, see &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4257/have-there-been-any-anime-with-actual-product-placement"&gt;Have there been any anime with actual product placement?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, taking the steps to formally arrange this kind of thing requires more effort and comes with more risk, so I can see why anime productions tend to go with the less risky parody names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi_Score_Girl" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Score Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This manga got into legal trouble because it directly featured lots of 90s video game content, even though its publisher, Square Enix, took steps to secure formal consent for the use of the games' characters from the various companies. In 2014, SNK Playmore &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-06/hi-score-girl-manga-recalled-after-snk-copyright-charges/.77361" rel="noreferrer"&gt;launched an IP violation claim&lt;/a&gt; against Square Enix because of this manga, which resulted in the recall of all the volume and digital publications of the manga. It took about a year before the two parties reached a settlement and the lawsuit was withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case had more to do with copyright than trademark, but it's still a good example of the kind of trouble that could come arise if you're not careful enough with handling the intellectual property of others... &lt;em&gt;High Score Girl&lt;/em&gt; really did include a lot of stuff though, so this was a particularly complex case. For reference, here's the copyright notice in volume 1 of the manga:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OfaQy.png" alt="lots and lots of (c) company names"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There seems to be more of this woman, as when I start a new game, the first cutscene shows a group of them gathering above the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm currently on the final battle. At first, I thought the woman was Lorelei, but the characters call Lorelei a he. I checked the walkthrough to see if I was on the very last battle, since in &lt;em&gt;Tales of Graces F&lt;/em&gt; there was a second story after I defeated Lambda which focused on fighting Little Queen, I confirmed that the fights I'm on are the last. (Then again, the walkthrough is for the PS2 version. A second story could have been added for the 3DS version, but I doubt it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since I'm at the endgame, I am still wondering who this woman is?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20799">&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure it the spirit of &lt;a href="http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Yulia_Jue" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Yulia Jue&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In general, don't count on being able to find subtitled versions of children's shows - if children's shows do get released in an English-speaking country, they'll almost certainly be dubbed.

</answer></question><question Id="28170" Title="Can SpaceTime Jutsu users do time travel?" Body="&lt;p&gt;We know that Obito's Kamui, Tobirama/Minato's Flying Thundergod are SpaceTime jutsus. They are using the fourth dimension to go to any/marked places at will. As per physics &amp;amp; Theory of relativity, if you have mastered the fourth dimension you can do both Space AND Time travel. Why can't they do time travel when they can do space travel ?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28171">&lt;p&gt;To time travel, one needs to be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel#Via_faster-than-light_.28FTL.29_travel" rel="nofollow"&gt;faster than light&lt;/a&gt;. While those ninjas use Time-Space Jutsu, none of them are faster than light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obito&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three, Obito is the slowest as his space-time jutsu (kamui) has some delay, proven by Kakashi's successfully landing attack on him before he managed to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senju Tobirama &amp;amp; Namikaze Minato&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are very fast. Minato can even teleport to one of his marked kunai. I'm not sure if Tobirama can also do that, I don't remember. But the point is, although they are incredibly fast, they are not faster than light. We can safely say this, because if they are faster than light, then Minato wouldn't have his arm ripped by Madara and Tobirama won't be pinned on the ground. They would have been able to avoid Madara's attacks if they are faster than light. Thus, they cannot time travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other possible ways to time travel that I know is by the use of Wormhole, which doesn't exist in Naruto universe.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="2549" Title="Why didn't Naruto learn the basics of chakra control?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Naruto, shinobi battles last a very long time consuming lots of chakra.  Even though Naruto has a lot of chakra, he ignored the basics and started learning high level techniques with Jiraiya.  Even though this wasn't a bad thing, he just kept learning higher levels of techniques without using the basics, causing him to waste more chakra for high level jutsus.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why hasn't Naruto learned how the use the bare minimum the start his jutsus?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Know that if he did that, he wouldn't have had to rely on the Kyuubi's power and would probably be able the do rasen shuriken one more time, or at least have some chakra left over for retreating or finishing off the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2550">&lt;p&gt;Given that Naruto is a slow learner and the possibility of Kyuubi's interference, Jiraiya realised it would take him a long time to learn the chakra control, and decided that the benefit gained from it is not worth the time spent. Since Naruto has abundant chakra reserves, Jiraiya decided that learning how to tap it is of higher priority than chakra control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, many of the times when Naruto learned a new technique (Frog Summoning, Rasengan, Rasenshuriken, Sage Mode, Kyuubi chakra mode), he had to do it within some time limit, so he could not take his own sweet time learning chakra control, and hence, sticked to his original learning method. It is possible that Jiraiya did teach Naruto some chakra control during the time they travelled together, but there is not enough evidence of this happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when Naruto began training with Ebisu during the one month training break before the Chunin exam finals, Ebisu did tell him to learn to use his chakra more efficiently. However, after Jiraiya took over his training, he asked Naruto to focus on power rather than control, since he felt that style suited Naruto better.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="42580">&lt;p&gt;By the time he is likely a jounin by &lt;em&gt;The Last: Naruto the Movie&lt;/em&gt; 2 years after the Kaguya fight, he can form a rasen shuriken with a single hand. His control was so great and progressed so much during the war, he was able to share chakra with everyone. Basically, the Kyuubi was in the way and when he was no longer in the way, his abilities shot up and his control became so much greater because he had to train in 'higher gravity'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion, he was constantly improving his control, but the Kyuubi was interfering throughout most of his life so he had to gain more control than the average person to make up for it. When he no longer had interference, it was no longer a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Schodt, is a 500 page treasure trove of interviews and other works regarding Miyazaki's thoughts and inspirations on his films. I purchased this book many years ago and only read a portion of it, so I can't really attest to how much this will help, but it's a good starting point for your research on his other films (pun may or may not be intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazuma then asked how he died, then Aqua told him how he died of shock and wet himself, she also told him how every doctor and his family was laughing at how ridiculous his death was.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36518">&lt;p&gt;Kazuma died because of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the girl will survive even if Kazuma didn't save her. The vehicle that was moving towards the girl was just a slow tractor. After he pushed the girl, Kazuma died because of heart attack, he thought it was a truck and he was scared to death.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39962">&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion, and this isn't proven anywhere but: He did in fact see it correctly and attempted to save the girl but both of them died in the accident, and she didn't want to tell Kazuma that his life ended in tragic failure and in vain. Thus the "getting out some stress" comment. Now while that is debunked by how bad a liar she is, at this point she was still a Goddess and had time to think it up, and her personality does change a bit after joining Kazuma in the alternate world. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha&lt;/em&gt; Season 1, Yuuno says that the Lost Logia are remnants of advance civilizations that have since been destroyed, but in Season 3 during Hayate and Fate's briefing on the relic they seem to imply that the Lost Logia come from a single civilization (Al Hazard maybe?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I am wondering, what exactly are the Lost Logia?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6123">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Lost Logia&lt;/em&gt; is a piece of technology from an ancient world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen &lt;em&gt;Lost Logia&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Ancient Belka&lt;/em&gt; (Book of Darkness, Bible of Silver Cross) and &lt;em&gt;Al Hazard&lt;/em&gt; (Jewel Seed, Relic, Saints Cradle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nanoha lives in &lt;em&gt;Mid-Childa&lt;/em&gt;, and for them &lt;em&gt;Ancient Belka&lt;/em&gt; is a lost world. For the inhabitants of &lt;em&gt;Ancient Belka&lt;/em&gt; during the &lt;em&gt;Belkan War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Al Hazard&lt;/em&gt; was a lost world to them as well. Due to the &lt;em&gt;Belkan War&lt;/em&gt; you can see a lot of influences from &lt;em&gt;Al Hazard&lt;/em&gt; as they tried to harness the immeasurable power of the &lt;em&gt;Lost Logia&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Al Hazard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the collapse of &lt;em&gt;Ancient Belka&lt;/em&gt;, they tried to rebuild their empire using the &lt;em&gt;Al Hazard Lost Logia&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Saint's Cradle&lt;/em&gt;. That was the &lt;em&gt;Saint King Unification War&lt;/em&gt; with the lovable &lt;em&gt;Olivie S&#228;gebrecht&lt;/em&gt;. So that is a bit of history of the &lt;em&gt;Lost Logia&lt;/em&gt;, a technology which has been lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the 'magic' that Nanoha uses is technology as well, except that it is not mass-based (like a Nuclear Bomb), but magic-based (an energy coming from living beings, apparently) and was chosen technology for the &lt;em&gt;Time Space Administration&lt;/em&gt; due to it being clean and relatively safe.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="14447" Title="Please help identify this anime or OVA from 14 years ago about magic" Body="&lt;p&gt;OK this is a long shot as I only remember two scenes. It's just stuck with me and I would be very interested in finding out what anime it was. I saw it about 14 (maybe 15) years ago and I don't know if it was new then or not (probably not anime was never a big thing in the UK back then). I think I saw it on the Bravo channel but I'm guessing as it was the only channel willing to show anime that had anything remotely interesting (other channels had heavily edited Kiddy stuff).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first scene I remember was a stand-off from two wizards (or magic users). One was an old man on the ground, I think he had white hair. He was facing an evil wizard who was levitating some distance away (yet they could hear other as they always seem to do in anime). The old wizard shot some kind of magic arrow that he seemed very certain would kill this evil wizard but the evil wizard blocked it with the palm of his hand which was in a white glove with an up-side-down pentagram. The old wizard clutched then clutched his heart, bleeding as if struck by the arrow (which was still in the evil wizard's hand who seemed unaffected by this), shocked at what had happened, and then fell down, presumably dead. The old wizard laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other scene was of some woman, supposedly important but I can't remember why - I think the evil wizard wanted her for something? She was writhing in pain on the floor. It's daylight and they'd in a meadow or plains (short grass and where she rolled there was just dirt). She stops writhing but continues shaking and starts wretching, heaving. Suddenly something pokes out from her mouth and starts coming out of her, it ends up being a giant white-pink maggot which promptly wriggles away. She survives the ordeal and lays there shaking, recovering. There's a voice over of two men who I think were with her but not showing at the time. One is younger asking what happened and one is older (possibly the old wizard I mentioned earlier) explained she gave birth to a maggot and this was due to dark magic. Oddly, neither seem surprised by the fact there is a maggot almost the size of an adult human or concerned that the maggot might become a giant fly (which are annoying pests when tiny and swattable - a giant fly is just... Ick). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From the haziness of my memory I am not sure what kind of setting it is. The clothing is all simple but also something you'd expect in older Japan - robes and basic plain cloth type. I don't recall the buildings but I think it is pre-machine times so I don't think there's cars or guns.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The animation style has that older grittier texture to it which all the older anime seem to have - something between Violence Jack and CyberCity Oeda 808. I think it was a movie/OVA rather than a series but I may be mistaken. I get the impression it was a &quot;not for kids&quot; kind of anime (even though I was a kid at the time) but I'm guessing on that because back then those were the only ones I watched (except for Vampire Princess Miyu) and because it was an 'after 10pm watershed' thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't really have much more detail than this I am sorry but it stayed with me and can't seem to find it when I do my searches.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3Ubg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(From Wikipedia):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Doomed Megalopolis (&#24093;&#37117;&#29289;&#35486; Teito Monogatari?) is a supernatural/dark fantasy anime. It is an adaptation of the historical fantasy novel Teito Monogatari by Hiroshi Aramata. The anime is darker, more violent and sexualized than any previous adaptations of the novel; an artistic decision probably inspired by the financial success of the OVA Legend of the Overfiend. Like its live-action predecessor, Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis, the anime is only an adaptation of the first 1/3rd (the first four books) of the original novel.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It was released by Toei in 1991 as a 4-part OVA. In 1995, ADV Films gained the rights to the anime and released it on a four-volume cassette series in the US, under the title Doomed Megalopolis. In 2001, ADV re-released the entire series on a 2-Disc DVD edition. However, this release did not have the original Japanese soundtrack or any special features. Eventually, ADV gathered the rights to the original Japanese voices, and in 2003, re-released an enhanced version entitled Doomed Megalopolis: Special Edition, wherein the Japanese language option was available and bonus features, such as interviews and documentaries were added.[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's around the right time frame, though it's not listed under the programs broadcasted by Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main antagonist is an evil wizard with white gloves with a pentagram on it, and in the beginning of the movie, he blocks the arrow:&lt;/p&gt;

To her surprise, he gently replies that he loves her too, and Sakura realizes he didn't lose his feelings for her after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How was this possible? Was it because of the Hope Card?  I just need some explanation for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4008">&lt;p&gt;Before the Sealed Card was able to attack and gather Syaoran's most important feeling, the Hope Card negated it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain it more clearly, it was because the nameless card nullified the power of the sealed card to obtain Syaoran's feelings. With regard to this, Sakura's powerful emotions towards Li made that happen. The Sealed card and the nameless card merged in the process, creating the Hope Card. That is why the Hope Card or the Love Card (which was called in the english dub) was the card who doesn't have a clow card counterpart, meaning it only exist as a Sakura Card because it was created by Sakura's feelings towards Li Syaoran.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 12, 4:58 there is a part were Lelouch and C.C are fighting, then the scene changes, C.C seems to be lying unconscious, while Lelouch is mad and taking a shower.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What happened there? Did he kill her? Beat her? Rape her?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/ObGb64SdKeo?t=4m58s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://youtu.be/ObGb64SdKeo?t=4m58s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7681">&lt;p&gt;She isn't sleeping or unconscious as after Lelouch calls Ohgi we see C.C is awake (6:15), remember, this is C.C, she will usually lounge around the place eating Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lelouch learned moments before that his actions at the Battle of Narita caused the death of Shirley's father&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversation between Lelouch and Shirley:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shirley: Lou Lou, tell me. Zero, he fights for the weak doesn't he?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Lelouch: What? Yea, well that's what he says&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Shirley: Then why did he kill my father? You know my father, was so gentle. He never ever hurt me. He didn't do anything wrong. But, he was buried alive. He couldn't breathe. Why? Why did my father have to die?! I don't want this! Please, Lou Lou. Help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this shakes Lelouch's resolve after he realizes his actions caused someone's death but the effects of that death didn't stop at that person dying, C.C reminds him of what he said to Taizo Kirihara in the Mt. Fuji Mines and also reminds him that he has already killed many times before, rebuking the way he is acting now after he truly understands what it means to be responsible for taking lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lelouch pins down C.C in anger because he didn't want to hear the truth, claiming he was prepared for this the moment he killed his half brother Clovis, yet C.C is saying he wasn't and he need to be now cause Shirley wont be the only person close to Lelouch who will be effected by Zero's war against Britannia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the scene cuts we hear a steel door, while there are no steel doors in the estate this is more of a metaphor of Lelouch locking himself away as he reflects what he has done, this is why he is in the shower banging his fist into the wall as the truth C.C said is something he still couldn't accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what happened just before the cut, well the steel door is also probably indicating Lelouch stormed out, but then why is C.C just laying there not moving, well also remember she is an Immortal so she's probably kept herself at arms length to people and tried not to understand them, she probably didn't realize that while she was trying to help Lelouch's shaken resolve she was hurting him as well and is probably thinking on weather she was too harsh&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been reading around everywhere on this topic and haven't really come to a proper understanding.&#10;From what I've read, Ed beats truth by sacrificing his gate and from this he gets to take Al back home.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now this doesn't make sense. Does this mean that he essentially sacrificed everything, his ability to do alchemy, and in return he gets to &quot;take anything you want&quot; which is what Truth says back to him in the Japanese dub?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's the deeper philosophical meaning to this? Why would you give up/sacrifice/destroy truth? Isn't it important to know the truth?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Does sacrificing truth destroy it, i.e. the truth is you can't do this, so I sacrifice truth, and truth doesn't exist except what I think it is?&#10;So I become truth and essentially I can do anything because I am truth?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Any explanations?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49136">&lt;p&gt;The following is my interpretation of the end of the series. It does not necessarily reflect the original author's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmarked Spoilers Below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of Ed's sacrifice at the end of the series is that he finally understood the truth about alchemy, and, more specifically, the Law of Equivalent Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the intro, Alphonse says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the series, Ed and Al believe wholeheartedly that almost everything can be solved with alchemy. That's why they attempted human transmutation to begin with - they see everything as an alchemical equation. They felt that there must be some way to bring back their mother using alchemy, and that there must be some way to restore their original bodies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the series progresses, the brothers begin to discover holes in this seemingly ironclad (fullmetal?) law of alchemy. They discover that Izumi Curtis had also attempted human transmutation, trying and failing to revive her infant child. Following this, when Edward spends some time in Resembool after visiting the ruins of Xerxes, Hohenheim suggests that the creature they transmuted back at the beginning of the series was not even their mother. Upon examining the remains, he and Pinako confirm that this is indeed the case. Knowing this, Edward comes to the conclusion that &lt;strong&gt;bringing someone back from the dead is impossible,&lt;/strong&gt; which he tells Izumi in Episode 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mTqR9m.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mTqR9m.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revalation is significant. If there are some things that are impossible with alchemy, like bringing someone back from death, it implies that there may be some things that do not have a set alchemical value. This throws a wrench into the law of Equivalent Exchange, since &lt;strong&gt;if not everything can be quantified by alchemy, Equivalent Exchange cannot be the only truth of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this other truth is, though, eludes everyone up until the climax of the series, when Edward performs his final transmutation. He realizes how he can get his brother back &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; keep his body. As he does this, Hohenheim seems to figure it out, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/csJyT.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/csJyT.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Edward faces Truth, and offers him his own personal gate of truth in exchange for Alphonse's body. They exchange the following dialogue (English sub of Japanese dub):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Truth: You would lower yourself to become just a normal person, unable to use alchemy?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: "Lower myself," nothing. I've been just a person from the start. An insignificant human who couldn't save a little girl who had been made into a Chimera.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Truth: You're sure you'll be okay without it?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward (thinking of his friends and family): Even without alchemy, I still have them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Truth: That is the right answer, alchemist. You have beaten me. Take it with you. All of it! The back door is over there, Edward Elric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward has realized something critical, something that circumvents even Equivalent Exchange. What gives him value is not his ability to do alchemy, but his loved ones. In Ed's eyes, &lt;strong&gt;he does not exchange anything of value, yet gains "everything" (his brother, his friends, and his family).&lt;/strong&gt; He has not been lowered or decreased at all by losing his gate ("I've just been a person from the start"), but has instead increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphonse expands on this principle when he meets with the Hughes family in the epilogue: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alphonse: We were afforded a lot of happiness, a lot of happiness, in a lot of places by a lot of people...including Mr. Hughes. And so, now, we feel it's out turn to return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Gracia: Is that equivalent exchange, like the alchemists say?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Alphonse: No, by taking ten, and giving ten, it all ends up the same. So we take ten, put something of ourselves on top of it, and return 11. It's not much, but it's a new principle we've hit upon. Now we have to go and prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This "new principle" as Alphonse puts it, is that hidden truth beyond Equivalent Exchange. It's what Edward did to get Al's body back - he took what was there (his own body), added some of himself (his gate) and was able to come out with more than what he came in with (his body and his brother).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry reinforces this idea again right at the end of the last episode: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: Equivalent exchange! I'll give you half of my life, if you give me half of yours!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Winry: Why do alchemists have to be like this? The principle of equivalent exchange is all nonsense, isn't it? &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Winry: It really is nonsense. Never mind half, I'll give you all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Edward (after some banter): You really are amazing! You turn equivalent exchange on its ear so easily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry, by giving Ed "her whole life" (or at least 85 percent of it) is once again not decreasing or losing anything, but instead gaining something, just as Ed is gaining something by giving her his whole life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed drives this point home with his final line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Edward: There's no point to lessons that don't bring with them pain. People can't gain anything without sacrificing something, after all. But once you've successfully endured that pain, you gain a heart that is stout enough not to be overcome by anything. Yeah, a heart made fullmetal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go through a painful lesson, you pay the price in pain, and in turn, gain a lesson learned, but you also gain something extra - a heart made fullmetal, able to withstand anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question, he beats Truth by realizing that there are things alchemy cannot quantify, things with infinite value, and by choosing them over alchemy, he has effectively gained everything and lost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FndEB.png" alt="Chapter 3 - Conversation about Aikido"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various scenes in the first few chapters that shows Misaki using Aikido moves. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the middle of chapter 1, Misaki threw a sandbag over her head to clear the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of chapter 2, Misaki used Aikido on a male student who was half-naked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the middle of chapter 3, Misaki used Aikido on the members of the student council who slacked off at the beginning of the chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of chapter 3, Misaki used Aikido on the 2 masochists.&lt;/li&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;The second trailer of the movie &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&lt;/em&gt; seems to show Goku and Vegeta were born at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this so, didn't the series state differently? If so, which version of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; story would be canon now, the series or this movie?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49043">&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Vegeta is older as Goku was only an infant (about 0-1 yr old) when he was sent to Earth, while Vegeta was already fighting in another planet (about 5 yrs old), so Vegeta is about 5 yrs older than Goku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note however, that both Goku and Vegeta have died several times (both twice I think) and both have trained in the "Spirit and Time Room"* where staying 1 day is equal to 1 year in the outside/real world. So their physical bodies are several years younger than their actual ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I don't know how they translate this in the English dub/sub, but this is how I would based on the original Japanese &#31934;&#31070;&#12392;&#26178;&#12398;&#37096;&#23627;.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="50873">&lt;p&gt;It does not necessarily show that both Goku and Vegeta were born in the same year in the new movie. It is mever shown that Goku and Vegeta are both in saiyan incnbators at the same time so they are not the same age. Even if they are in incubators at the same time one may be in for a longer period in comparison to the other. When Goku was in an incubator it was shown that Vegeta was on another planet with Nappa as their home planet got destroyed. While Vegeta was on anothet planet it was shown that Goku was still in an incubator and then Bardock decied to put him in a pod and send him to Earth where he may lived safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Vegeta was said to be born in the Year 732 while Goku in 737 so Vegeta is 5 years older than Goku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the time both have spent in the Hyperbolic time chamber make them a year older than they actually should have been and if you want to classify it as this then you can. Their physical bodies are older than their actual ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, at some point they can try to create things they don't remember (for example, the cannon at guild basement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably, one or two people from the guild remember weapons, and they instruct the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For creating skills (power, abilities, body weapons), they need to know how to code and have a computer. They can get a computer from the computer room #1, but they also need the Angel Player software and a programmer (and apparently, only Takeyama knows how to do it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you don't know if the Angel Player is a software from the afterlife, or a software created by Tenshi. Maybe, the software itself is more difficult to create.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of being protected by her, I want to protect her!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This wish forced her to go back in time and re-live the month since her meeting with Madoka 100-ish times.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But in the end of the main timeline (ep.12), it is still Madoka that saves the day &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; by wishing to rescue all magic girls before they &quot;completely&quot; turn into witches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since the world was rebooted by Madoka's wish we briefly see events that happened during that month, such as&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Sayaka's despair for being unable be with Kamijou, only to be rescued by Madoka.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I won't address the Rebellion movie in this question body, but feel free to include it in the answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since by the end of ep.12 it does not feel like Homura's wish was fulfilled, question remains:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was it fulfilled, if yes, when and how?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35809">&lt;p&gt;If you are referring to how Homura can still have her wish granted in Madoka's Universe, one reason could be, as &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/35802/when-and-how-was-homuras-wish-fulfilled#comment48048_35802"&gt;Euphoric said&lt;/a&gt;, it's a paradox. but then again we can say that for anything, it's more fun to see what we can infer from what we have seen, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second could be what I am going to call the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Room of Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (my term, not canon, since it has no name to my knowledge). We see the Room or Origin twice as being the center point of the universe being created. the first time was when Madoka recreated the universe and the second time was when Homura did it at the end of Rebellion (in Rebellion Homura says she's been there once before when the Incubator asks where they were). Since this is really ground zero for the start of the new universe we can make the assumption that a part of the old universe still exists inside the Room or Origin, serving as the basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third reason could be that Homura retained her memories and abilities because she was key to creating Madoka's Universe. It was her terminating the timelines that compiles Madoka's Karmic Destiny that allowed her to become a god. In Homura's Universe Madoka regaining her memories would return her to becoming the full Law of Cycles once more and Sayaka retaining her memories initially could be because she is a part of the Law of Cycles as her secretary until Homura sealed them and probably sealed Nagisa before hand (since she did create a new life for Nagisa)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="3629" Title="Where did the mecha genre originate from in Japan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was wondering where mecha genre in Japan originated. It doesn't seem the same as something like the idea of a doll having a soul, which is from Japanese folk beliefs, but it could be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there some historical basis for giant fighting robots (or similar things) in Japan? If not, where did they originate from, and what was the first series that showed them?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3630">&lt;p&gt;There is no deep origin of the super robot trope in Japanese folklore, at least as it pertains to anime and manga. While some Japanese legends and history (such as the &lt;em&gt;samurai&lt;/em&gt;) may have influence the design and characteristics of the mechas, there is little direct inspirational influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first anime adaptation of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsujin_28-go" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetsujin 28-go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; manga, in 1963, is widely credited as the origin of the mecha genre with an early design of a "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Robot" rel="noreferrer"&gt;super robot&lt;/a&gt;". This series, in conjunction with the manga &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Robo" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giant Robo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were the first to feature these designs. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuteru_Yokoyama" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Mitsuteru Yokoyama&lt;/a&gt;*, as the creator of both these manga, is considered the father of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yokoyama was largely influenced by the wartime of his days; the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Kobe_in_World_War_II" rel="noreferrer"&gt;bombing of Kobe&lt;/a&gt; is one such case. He was also influenced by the monster concept from &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro Boy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 1952 manga series, has also had great influence over the design of the robots seen in the mecha genre&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://theyokocritic.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/the-evolution-of-mecha-design/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit more history: Notable mecha series that followed Yokoyama's creations were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazinger" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mazinger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (one of the first to feature piloting) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam" rel="noreferrer"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;. In the 90s, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; moved forward from the clunky, overly mechanized (and often blocky) mechas from the prior series, and introduced sleeker, faster designs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neon_Genesis_Evangelion&amp;amp;oldid=549838327#Legacy" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Later series, such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurren_Lagann" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gurren Lagann&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RahXephon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mimicked this design, while few shows like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Braves_GaoGaiGar" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GaoGaiGar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* - Yokoyama also made significant other contributions to Japanese comic culture; these can be found in the linked WIkipedia article.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="3631">&lt;p&gt;While this is conjecture, I'd say that mecha in manga and anime rose as a result of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;tokusatsu&lt;/a&gt; (special effects) wave of the 50s beginning with 1954's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gojira&lt;/a&gt; (Godzilla), a character created due to nuclear radiation. This huge &lt;em&gt;kaiju&lt;/em&gt; was partly based on King Kong (1933):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The special-effects artist Eiji Tsuburaya and the director Ishir&#333; Honda became the driving forces behind 1954's Godzilla. Tsuburaya, inspired by the American film King Kong, formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the genre, such as so-called suitmation&#8212;the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster&#8212;combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets. Godzilla forever changed the landscape of Japanese science fiction, fantasy, and cinema by creating a uniquely Japanese vision in a genre typically dominated by American cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These huge rampaging monsters were initially countered by puny humans, then by powerful pint-sized humans, powerful pint-sized robots/androids and then by huge robotic superheroes controlled from the outside and then from the inside. Tezuka's 1952 manga, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Astro Boy&lt;/a&gt;, featured one such pint-sized robot superhero who was himself based on the character of &lt;em&gt;Michi&lt;/em&gt; in his 1949 manga, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28manga%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Metropolis&lt;/a&gt; (in turn based on the 1927 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Fritz Lang masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;). Michi is an artificially "synthesised" boy who, later in the story, goes around toppling skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/3630/247"&gt;by Eric&lt;/a&gt;, 1956's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsujin_28-go" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gigantor&lt;/a&gt; featured a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Robot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Super Robot&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a kid on the outside while the 1972 manga, Mazinger Z, was apparently the first to feature the controller on the inside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The idea of a robot controlled by a young hero was first used in 1956 with Iron Man 28 or Tetsujin 28-go (dubbed and released in the US as Gigantor), by manga artist Mitsuteru Yokoyama, which featured a giant robot piloted by remote-control by a young boy named Shotaro Kaneda, who used it to fight against evil. However, the first anime to use the phrase Super Robot and the one that set the standards for the genre was Mazinger Z, created by Go Nagai and making its debut in manga publications and TV in 1972. The main difference between Mazinger Z and previous robots was that the hero, Koji Kabuto, would pilot the robot from the inside in the same manner as one would drive a car. This anime show was hugely popular and spanned numerous sequels and imitations during the 1970s, and revival shows later during the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="35695" Title="Is Kayaba Akihiko the boss of the 100th floor of New Aincrad?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime &lt;em&gt;Sword Art Online&lt;/em&gt;, the floors from 76-100 have been untouched since Kirito beat Kayaba, but before Kirito does so, Kayaba Akihiko said, &quot;I was meant to be the final boss at the 100th floor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that there is a &lt;strong&gt;New Aincrad&lt;/strong&gt; built in Alfheim Online.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that Kayaba Akihiko is waiting on the 100th floor for a rematch? Or could the end boss just be another random boss for them to fight?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35696">&lt;p&gt;To my understanding New Aincrad's Floor 100 has to to be revealed however the likelihood that it's Akihiko Kayaba is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Sword Art Online was cleared Kayaba did a full dive and it was reported that he was killed in the process. it can be speculated that the Full Dive was successful however there is no evidence to definitely prove that Kayaba is alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Aincrad was released by Ymir, the company that now own Alfheim Online. the data from New Aincrad pre-exited on the Alfhiem Online Serves because of how ALO is a copy of SAO, however Aincrad had been altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Due to the bought ALO data including copied data from the old Sword Art Online server, New Aincrad (with several changes from the original Aincrad in SAO) and Sword Skills were introduced into ALfheim Online and surviving SAO players were able to inherit their avatar data from SAO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Ymir" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ymir - Background (Second Paragraph)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Floors of New Aincrad are being slowly released so there is an upper limit until an update. this is evident in Sword Art Online 2 Episode 18 where Agil shows Kirito and Asuna the release notes for the next ALO update, including the introduction of the 21st-30th floors of New Aincrad. so at the moment (as of the end of Sword Art Online 2, I haven't read the Novels) no one can access Floor 100. if i was to speculate there is no data for Floor 100 (except for the outside appearance for the sake of scenery) until the update is released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35707">&lt;p&gt;My answer is the same with Memor-X, but for a different reason. It is next to impossible for Kayaba to be the final boss for floor 100 of New Aincrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Memor-X said in his answer, Kayaba is &lt;strong&gt;dead, physically&lt;/strong&gt;. I say physically because it was shown that Kayaba is &lt;strong&gt;alive as a data&lt;/strong&gt; after he did full dive and transferred his consciousness into the network. This was explained in the Light Novel by his former assistant, &lt;a href="http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Koujiro_Rinko" rel="nofollow"&gt;Koujiro Rinko&lt;/a&gt;. Kayaba did show up when Kirito went against Oberon at the climax of Alfheim Online, but after that, &lt;strong&gt;his whereabouts is unknown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayaba was responsible for the death of players in the original Aincrad. He was the one who trapped everyone inside the game and made it so that the system kills anyone who died in the game. This makes him &lt;strong&gt;a wanted man&lt;/strong&gt;. If he is physically alive, he would have been arrested and brought for trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having Kayaba as the final boss of the 100th floor of New Aincrad would be a &lt;strong&gt;bad move for the company&lt;/strong&gt; to make. How would people feel if, let's say Square-Enix use Hitler as the final boss for Final Fantasy? Same case with Kayaba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Kayaba as the boss of the 100th floor of New Aincrad? It is next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39056">&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the movie &lt;em&gt;Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Kirito and his friends are fighting the Boss on Floor 100 of Aincrad. The Boss isn't Heathcliff, just a very strong Monster with a huge size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="46813">&lt;p&gt;All I know is that in the movie &lt;em&gt;SAO: Ordinal Scale&lt;/em&gt;, Kirito and everyone else advanced to floor 100 as to beat the boss and stop all the monsters IRL. I do believe that as Kayaba Akihiko commit suicide, he wasn't on floor 100 of new Aincrad. However, when Sword Art Online was still running, he was. Although it looked like floor 100 was a little easy to beat as there weren't many people helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure they would of all been jealous that Kirito got the floor 100's sword. Even though I am trying to stay on topic, it was said in Aincrad, in Liz's blacksmith shop, that Kirito had the best sword a monster could drop, however, Kirito gains a much better sword from floor 100. Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I've just started watching the 4th season of &lt;em&gt;High School DxD&lt;/em&gt; (Hero). I know it's been a while since I've last seen the previous episodes. However, in episode 2, this line in Kiba's speech made me wonder if I had missed any episodes/OVA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/M56YWl.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Kiba&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Kiba: I heard you had to deal with the four Great Devils?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few seconds after, Issei had a flashback and then I was sure, I missed some episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GqNxl.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Issei&amp;#39;s flashback&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Unknown character: Right now, you are finally in front of many doors with a key in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is Issei's flashback from any OVA/movie/episode? Which one?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48112">&lt;p&gt;That's referring to the events in one of the short stories from Volume 8, &lt;em&gt;Extra Life: The Fun Gremory Family&lt;/em&gt;. It was never adapted in any form, so the only way to know what happened is to read the novel. Fortunately, Volume 8 is a collection of short stories, so they can be read in any order; you could even read that short story alone and not feel lost at all as long as you've watched the first 3 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd still recommend reading the whole series in its novel form, as the 3rd season really butchered the series, pretty much mixing the stories from volume 5 and 7 into a single arc, and then closing the season with the events from volume 6 but with an anime original ending that was scrapped by Episode 0 of the 4th Season. It was THAT bad. Especially since mixing vol. 5 and 7 ended up in cutting the Rating Game between Rias and Sona, which Issei references in the latest season when he talks about wanting to pay back Saji after "losing" against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is further proven in R2 when has to deal with the guy who has the Geass canceler. Again Lelouch and his brother Rolo were able to detect him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of watched a few episodes recently but I did watch both series some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47913">&lt;p&gt;No the geass symbol in the eye is not visible, otherwise it would be really easy to identify such people. people would freak out if they same someone with such a weird eye and that never happens.&lt;br&gt;
The one weird exception to this is Lelouch who reacted like he could see Mao's geass symbol. Maybe other geass users can see it (unlikely) or maybe Lelouch was just clever enough to understand it (most likely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red rings around the eyes of geassed people is similar, it's invisible for the people in the show. That's because it's "non-diegetic" information, which means it's information which only exists for the audience and isn't actually part of the universe. Code Geass usues a lot of non-diegetic information, for example the red sphere in which "time is stopped" by Rolo's geass, or the sphere in which Jeremiah uses his geass, people can't see those either.
Non-diegetic information is very common and all storytelling sues that. The easiest example is background music which tells the audience when a scene is sad, romantic, scary ..., there's obviously no music playing for the characters in the fiction itself. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I've always wondered this, but why do anime series titles change so often whenever it gets a new &quot;season&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I understand that the title stays the same for long running series, like &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt;, but why do new &quot;seasons&quot; for one or two cour anime have slightly different names?

They're all direct sequels, so why not just give it the same name as the first season, like in American television? The source material keeps its name throughout its entire life (e.g. there was never a &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuuden&lt;/em&gt; manga or a &lt;em&gt;Shakugan no Shana III&lt;/em&gt; light novel), so why do their anime adaptations get different titles?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there a legal thing in Japan which disallows a production for one &quot;season&quot; to have the same name as another, for clarification purposes? Or do the producers/whoever chooses the names just want to attract more fans by making a distinction between different &quot;seasons&quot;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some insight into how the airing of anime works would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9707">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bellow is from my observations, i have no credible sources for this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the title changes are a meaning to their new season, ie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naruto Shippuuden&lt;/strong&gt;: Shippuuden means hurricane and Naruto in it is becoming for of a wind style Chakra User.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Watches Over Us&lt;/strong&gt;:  the second season is subtitled Printemps which means Spring in french which symbolizes not only the time the season is set but the "blooming" of new relationships after the Lady Roses graduate and the further blossoming relationship between Yumi and Sachiko&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha&lt;/strong&gt;: the second season is A's but it is pronounced as &#274;su which could a lot like Ace. it was the Book of Darkness incident which saw Nanoha, Fate and Hayate be seen by lower TSAB agents as Aces at their young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the use of a number (or in Sword Art Online roman numerals II) is more indicative of a new season since it just omits the word season in there (ie. Sword Art Online Season II, Shakugan no Shana Season III). i more or less think K-On is doing the same with the ! since if you flip it it's a lowercase I which when capitalized would be the roman numeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different name can also be used to show a distinction between 2 series such as story (Fullmetal Alchemist, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood), being a re-release (Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Z Kai) or having a new writer (Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT). for uses like S or F these could actually be words Second and Further&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;name changes can normally be a result of long "hiatus" periods between seasons as alot of anime is adapted from manga and light novels, as such a manga or light novel which would continue on long after the anime has stopped wouldn't have a name change but the anime would choose to adopt a subtitle when it resumes (if it resumes)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9713">&lt;p&gt;Okay, based on what I've learned &lt;a href="https://movies.stackexchange.com/q/19370/5764"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I think I understand why you're asking this question - it looks like it boils down to the fact American television and anime use the word "season" differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way anime is produced nowadays is that the production of a second season is almost always strongly contingent on the commercial success of the first season. As such, production will typically halt completely in between seasons - different seasons are &lt;strong&gt;different productions&lt;/strong&gt;. What this means is that what anime watchers call "seasons" are what American TV watchers call "series".&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this, I think, is the important insight. It is rare for American television to feature shows that have multiple &lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt; (separated by halts in production) set in the same continuity, since American television production functions differently. American shows typically semi-continuously churn out new content (a la &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;) until they get cancelled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the specific cases you used as examples (Railgun, Zero no Tsukaima, Medaka, SAO, OreImo, K-ON), it looks like all of them experienced halts in production between each season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I mean, I understand that the title stays the same for long running series, like &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, and the key factor here is that &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; are each one continuous production - because there was never a halt in production, they never got a new title.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The source material keeps its name throughout its entire life (e.g. there was never a &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuuden manga&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;Shakugan no Shana III&lt;/em&gt; light novel), so why do their anime adaptations get different titles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, this boils down to the fact that the &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; manga and the &lt;em&gt;Shakugan no Shana&lt;/em&gt; light novels were each one continuous production (as basically all manga series and light novels are). There's no logical breaking point at which to change titles in these cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm particularly interested in the last two, where the only noticeable difference in the title is a punctuation mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of using a punctuation mark rather than a subtitle or other designation to identify a new season is a stupid practice that has been "trendy" recently, and should (with any luck) die out eventually. Still, the idea is basically the same - &lt;em&gt;K-On!!&lt;/em&gt; could just as well have been called &lt;em&gt;K-On! 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;K-On!: This Time It's Cuter&lt;/em&gt; or whatever - anything to indicate that it's a separate production from the original series &lt;em&gt;K-On!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there a legal thing in Japan which disallows a production for one "season" to have the same name as another, for clarification purposes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert on Japanese law, but I would be astounded if this were the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addendum: the case of &lt;em&gt;Fairy Tail&lt;/em&gt; is interesting - it ran from Oct 2009 to Mar 2013, then stopped for a while, and picked back up again in Apr 2014. Despite this, the name of the series did not change - it was called &lt;em&gt;Fairy Tail&lt;/em&gt; both before and after the break in airing.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;em&gt;suspicion&lt;/em&gt; here is that the break in airing had been planned in advance, and that the producers had planned to resume airing once the manga had had some time to get ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is in fact the case, there would have been no reason to halt production during the break in airing - it was already known at the time airing stopped that they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be making more episodes. Contrast this with e.g. &lt;em&gt;Railgun&lt;/em&gt; - when the first season finished in 2010, they didn't know (for sure) that they'd be making a second season (which didn't end up happening until 2013). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In most cases, anime has no notion that is equivalent to what American TV watchers call "seasons"; the major exception would probably be long-running children's anime (think &lt;em&gt;Doraemon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sazae-san&lt;/em&gt;, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This explanation doesn't really work for &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Naruto Shippuden&lt;/em&gt;, though, and I'm not familiar enough with that show to posit an explanation. You might like to ask about that particular case separately if it interests you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Regarding which, see &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/8649/1908"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="9727">&lt;p&gt;It's simply a way of indicating to the viewer that the episodes are new. TV ratings wars are extremely ferece in Japan, as are DVD sales wars. The producers want even the show's title to scream "new!" at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of how bad it has become, TV channels often start their programming at weird times like 3 minutes to the hour or 7 minutes past the hour. The reason for this is to discourage people from changing channel. At 3 minutes to the hour everyone else is still showing adverts, so you start watching what they have. At 7 minutes past the programme you were just watching overran the start of other channel's shows. They will do pretty much anything to get viewers it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next part of your question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can implant eyes to someone that has lost sight on that eye(s). The Uchiha are known do do it a lot, or they at least to it to "reach the next level" of power (in their eyes) but they are either almost or are blind when doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another huge example (of doing this) is Kakashi. He lost his eyesight on his left eyes, and then got a Sharingan, which is a D&#333;jutsu, implanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope my answer helps, it's mostly what I know. I did try to find some references to help better but they were just about what D&#333;jutsu are and some examples and their abilities, which would be useless to you (according to what you asked, or was looking for, at least, so I did not include it).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also hope your fan fiction goes well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="30683" Title="Why did Izumo's familiars attack her in Blue Exorcist?" Body="&lt;p&gt;So I read the Manga and also watched the anime. There is an arc in the Manga that is not in the anime, the Illuminati arc where Izumo is kidnapped and taken to the Illuminati lair. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Those fox spirits, even if they hate her are like family to her. She considers them as her brothers. They went so far to lay down their lives for her then.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't get why would they attack her like that in the earlier episodes of the anime during one of the exorcist exams. Izumo was with her friend in the girl's bathroom where they were attacked and on summoning the spirits, they turned on her. It makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="30698">&lt;p&gt;Familiars in the manga are actually tamed demons. If the user is not properly trained in controlling them or have a disturbed state of mind then the go out of control. Before Izumo was attacked by ghouls, Paku said she was going to quit the course. Hence she was in a disturbed state of mind. So the familiars attacked her.
According to wiki about her foxes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;White Foxes appear to be very proud, even willing to turn against those they've been raised with if they sense weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31566">&lt;p&gt;It was stated in an episode (I don't remember which, or the exact quote) That any sign of weakness in the owner would result in hostility from the summoned familiars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the familiars, which all happen to be demons, do not wish to have the dishonour of serving and being under command of a "weak" ruler. Thus they attack when they sense weakness, removing the contract between owner and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As noted in Youth Health Mag, the sophomore run of the anime may not be arriving anytime soon since the manga is not even finished yet, which means that there &lt;strong&gt;isn't sufficient content to be adapted as of now.&lt;/strong&gt; "One Punch Man" manga is currently at chapter 86 titled "Garou Arc."
    It can be remembered that the first season closed with episode 12 wherein Saitama fought with Lord Boros. In manga, it happened around chapter 37. The Bit Bag also noted that it &lt;strong&gt;usually takes six to nine months or one to two years to develop a whole new season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="27684" Title="Why does no one notice the 2nd generation Digi-destined in Digimon Tri?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of episode 1 of Digimon Tri, we see glimpses of the second generation Digi-destined (Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken; sorry I only know their English dubbed names) being destroyed by what looks like Alphamon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Several (in universe) days have past since this event, so why has nobody inquired about what happened to them? I would imagine that they would be missing and somebody would notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are the 2nd gen Digi-destined even alive after their defeat?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="29760">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This Q&amp;amp;A is about an ongoing series as of the time of the posting, and future episodes may reveal more on the subject or change the perceptions shown here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a decade has passed since the defeat of MaloMyotismon and the restauration of the digi-world. The show did not yet disclose what happened to the 2nd generation digi-destined. It might be that they lost contact with the 1st gen, moved away, or any other explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our real world a decade is time enough to make even closest friends drift apart, more so when they are children, bound to move along with their parents when these parents change jobs or get transferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would hold my hat on that issue. It is very unlikely that Koushiro "Izzy" Izumi would allow digi-destined to not stay in touch. They even have a social network of sorts "Digi-destined of the World", that they use to warn the other digi-destined of the infected digimon returning to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, their apparent disappeareance is more likely to be a plot device, to be revealed in future episodes. It is not like they don't care or are not in touch, it just wasn't shown on screen &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44295">&lt;p&gt;During the first &lt;em&gt;Tri&lt;/em&gt; movie, it's mentioned that it had been a year since the close of the digital gate, and that it had not opened since. If anyone remembers during &lt;em&gt;Adventure 02&lt;/em&gt;, the premise was that the loss of the Destiny stones caused the digital world to merge, but BlackWarGreymon sealed the gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's at this point that time becomes alternate for &lt;em&gt;Digimon Tri&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than the dark spires reappearing, Himekawa is trying to get her digipartner back, much the same way that Oikawa had lost his partner. She sent Ken, Youli, Davis, and Cody back to the digital world, but they lost to Alphamon. As in dead, both they and their digital partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Himekawa is aware that these kids are 'offline' as shown in the computer screen. She purposefully infected Meicoomon with the dark power that Ken as the Digital Emperor had used in the form of control bands. The assumption is that she figured if she corrupted the digital world, it would force a reset to create homeostasis between the digital and real world. But she also has to deal with the original DigiDestined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other possibility is that Himekawa intended to get her partner back by recreating a digital partner, but instead got Meicoomon who wasn't a perfect digital creation, hence the infection, figured out that she would have to force a reboot and began eliminating the DigiDestined, starting with Ken, Davis, Youli, and Cody, and it was in fact Meicoomon who killed the kids. &lt;/p&gt;

Who is the leader?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5791">&lt;p&gt;Seeing as there are mentions of a royal family being inside Wall Sina, it's safe to assume that the government is monarchical in nature. However, I am leaning towards a monarchical-parliamentary style, rather than just pure monarchical or parliament. Reason being, even with hints at a king being the head, the actions alone of the various commanders belie an amazing level of independence. In addition, it's been seen a couple of times that they can be summoned and tried in a public court, a trait that is definitely not purely monarchical in nature (as kings alone judge in that event). The  voting system to approve a course of action mirrors a parliamentary set-up as well.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="28136" Title="Were any of Houkago Tea Time's songs described or referred to in the manga?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;K-On!!&lt;/em&gt; anime features a large number of songs performed by Houkago Tea Time. In addition to staples like &quot;Gohan wa Okazu&quot;  and &quot;Fuwa Fuwa Time&quot;, there are a number of other ones that I don't believe ever got playtime in the anime, like &quot;Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss&quot;, to say nothing of the OP/ED themes and their B-sides, plus a ton of character songs (and not just for the main five, but also for Ui, Jun, and Nodoka). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, I haven't read the manga, but it's clearly inconceivable that all these dozens of songs could have been described in any substantial way in a mere four volumes of manga. In fact, I have to wonder if any of these songs were even noted as existing in the manga.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do any of the songs in the anime originate in any way from the manga (even if only by virtue of a shared title or a lyrical excerpt)? If so, which ones?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Ignore &quot;Tsubasa wo Kudasai&quot;, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_wo_Kudasai&quot;&gt;a cover of a very old song&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28137">&lt;p&gt;This is all based on memory as I don't have the manga volumes to hand at the moment, but several of the songs were mentioned by title in the manga, and a few of them had lyrics shown that were used in the anime versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Fuwa Fuwa Time" was in the manga, and we even see its lyrics in one scene when Mio hands her draft of the song to the others for feedback. If I remember correctly, "Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss" and "Fudepen Ballpen" are mentioned on the set list before one of the concerts. I believe that "Curry Nochi Rice" was also mentioned late in the manga, and I'm fairly sure the storyline where Yui first writes "Gohan wa Okazu", then writes "U&amp;amp;I" for Ui after Ui falls ill happened in the manga the same way it happened in the anime. I believe we did also see the lyrics for "U&amp;amp;I" when Ui finds Yui asleep at her desk after working on the song all night and looks over what Yui wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening and ending themes were never mentioned or hinted at in the manga, and several of the other songs--e.g. "Pure Pure Heart", "Tenshi ni Nareta yo!"--were associated with anime-only plots. But a surprising number of the songs in the anime were actually mentioned by title in the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I bought the digital editions and hunted down photographic evidence of my earlier claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Volume 1, we see Ritsu and Sawako react with horror as they read Mio's draft of "Fuwa Fuwa Time".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUlRr.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUlRr.jpg" alt="fuwa fuwa time"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background of the third and fourth panels on the left, we can see the first few stanzas of the song translated into English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Volume 2, Mio hands Ritsu a set list with four songs on it: "Fuwa Fuwa Time", "Curry Nochi Rice", "Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss", and "Fudepen Ballpen":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4NMHl.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4NMHl.png" alt="set list vol 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in Volume 4, we see Yui write "Gohan wa Okazu":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xhqe1l.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xhqe1l.png" alt="gohan wa okazu"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then later "U&amp;amp;I":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGTApl.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGTApl.jpg" alt="u&amp;amp;i"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Volume 4, we also get a few lines from a song that Mio was working on, which provokes the usual revulsion in Ritsu and Azusa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjf31l.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjf31l.png" alt="unknown song"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the chapter, Ritsu declares that they'll develop a song around these lyrics in addition to "U&amp;amp;I" to spare Mio's feelings. However, I don't think there was any song in the anime based around these lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28138">&lt;p&gt;Of all the songs released, &lt;em&gt;Fuwa Fuwa Time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gohan was Okazu&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;U&amp;amp;I&lt;/em&gt; are the only pieces that appeared in the manga.  This can be verified by noticing that they are only songs whose lyrics are officially attributed to the original author.   You can look at the Note 28 of &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E3%81%91%E3%81%84%E3%81%8A%E3%82%93!&amp;amp;oldid=57176494#.E6.8C.BF.E5.85.A5.E6.AD.8C" rel="nofollow"&gt;the relevant article in the Japanese Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to see this.  Note that even for these songs, only some part of the songs appeared in the books; they were significantly augmented by a professional lyricist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; While flying the plane, it's struck by lightning. They activate the back up generator. They see that the auto-pilot is broken down so they have to cancel the landing. They manage to pull up but lose one engine in the process and damage the runway. The next thing they notice is that there isn't much fuel left. This is because when everyone was in the cockpit, Ban accidentally hit the fuel gauge button which made the fuel (in separate engines) go into one big tank.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Conan finds a place to land (Sakamori Dock). Kid (in disguise of Shinjo) says he can't do it because he injured his hand and that Ran should take his place. Kid opens the emergency hatch and tells them good luck. Kaitou Kid then jumps from the plane. Nakamori chasing the real Shinjo, notice the real kid flying, and so they chase after him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Conan tells Sonoko to take his place and that he has to go to the washroom, also to put on the headsets in case contact is made with the airport again. Conan uses his voice-changing bow tie and tells Ran using Shinichi's voice. Ran tells him to stop acting so cool and that the fate of these passengers is within her hands. She then tells him that she loves him which makes him go silent. She tells him that she see's a ribbon of red lights. Heading towards the dock. Conan sees it and realizes why Kid jumped off. He was going to attract the lights of the police to create a runway so they can see.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Ran successfully lands the plane. Ran thinks that the person who jumped was Kaitou Kid's accomplice and she was talking to Kaitou Kid. She is relieved to know her secret wasn't let out.  &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="36923" Title="What are the differences between the two personalities of Seij&#363;r&#333; Akashi?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Kuroko no Basket, the captain of Teiko Middle School and Rakuzan High is revealed to have a split personality. His original personality is shown to be that of a team player: likable and helpful to others. In his final year he suppressed this personality during his 1v1 match vs Murasakibara and awakened his special ability, Emperor Eye. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Midorima and Kuroko in particular note the personality changes in Akashi. The most obvious I can find is that the new personality refers to people by their first names i.e. Kuroko as Tetsuya, Midorima as Shintaro.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are there any other changes between the two personalities?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36959">&lt;p&gt;As far as I remember (it's been a while since the end of the manga) the most notable difference comes with the special ability that the personalities have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new personality has, as you said, The Emperor's Eye ability, which leads him to easily defeat most of his rivals in 1v1 or sometimes even in 1v2 or 1v3 depending on the "power" of his rivals. Also he acts like a superior being, considering himself way better than others and not caring about training or hard work, but just being interested in powerful teammates and in winning at every cost. Also he calls everyone by his first names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original, on the other side, is very helpful and proning to teamplay. Is because of this that he awakens his "true" special ability, wich is the "Zone" (that a lot of the main characters awaken in the story) but the difference with his zone is the fact that he can help every one of his teammates to enter in the zone without much effort, which makes this a very powerful and dangerous ability. This personality calls people by their last names as a sign of respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end he is able to combine both of them in order to become even a better basketball player having an enormous defense zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also and just as an interesting detail, the original personality has red eyes, while the "Emperor" one has one eye red and the other gilded.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38024">&lt;p&gt;The difference between the personalities is that the original Akashi was more fluent in his passes and most of his shots. You see this in the fight between Seirin and Rakuzan. The personality change was because he didn't want to lose his team, the only people who could understand him. But the change caused the Generation Of Miracles to break. Earlier on in season 3 it's shown that Midorima had noticed these indefinite changes between the original Akashi and The Emperor Akashi. The original Akashi wanted to bring his team closer so he switched to Emperor Eye. But it didn't do anything but push them away.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40847">&lt;p&gt;Akashi Seijuurou has a split personality, we'll call the first personality "Boku" and the second personality "Ore". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Boku" is mainly the personality that was shown in the first few Teiko years and also sometime during the Rakuzan-Seirin game. "Ore" was seen after his one-on-one with Murasakibara until the Rakuzan-Seirin game and also a bit in the Vorpal Swords-Jabberwocks game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Boku" is generally more caring until Aomine called Akashi "nagging mother". Honestly, I'd say that "Boku" kind of has an inferiority complex because he seems more humble and he admits in Teiko that everyone was becoming better than him. He also admits that he has a weakness of fearing being left behind (as pointed out by Ore during their mental talks). "Ore" on the other hand, has a superiority complex. He says that people should "lower their head" and that he is "absolute" and he is constantly so sure that he will always win. He calls people by their given name which is not really disrespectful or shows signs of superiority or anything but it's just more respectful to use the last names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another clear sign (in the anime) is that "Boku"'s eyes are both red while "Ore"'s eyes ahs the right one red and the left one yellow. It's not very noticeable in the manga. "Boku" also focuses a lot on team play while "Ore" focuses more on winning no matter what. This is why "Boku" can do things like perfect-rhythm-plays and gets not only him but his other teammates into the zone as well while "Ore" gets into the zone by abandoning all hope for his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of differences between the two personalities for the plays he makes. Of the two, it is said that "Boku" is stronger. However, both "Boku" and "Ore" were not strong enough to stop Nash and his Belial Eye and to defeat him, "Ore" had to disappear and transfer his abilities to "Boku" in order for the Emperor Eye to be complete. It's rather sad but... yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

Do all Shinigami &lt;em&gt;(Death Gods)&lt;/em&gt; love apples, is it the only food for Death Gods or does &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; just love apples? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also..

&lt;p&gt;This is most likely the reason why he enjoys apples. There's also probably some hidden meaning to it.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="3201">&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Apples"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apples are Ryuk's favorite food and probably the only thing he eats.
  &lt;em&gt;He likes apples from the human world because they are "so juicy"&lt;/em&gt;. Ryuk
  stated that apples are an addiction for him, like alcohol or
  cigarettes for humans. Ryuk exhibits symptoms of withdrawal if he goes
  without eating apples for a while. These symptoms include contorting
  his body into uncomfortable positions and desperation to the point
  that he will take orders for one (i.e. looking for hidden cameras in
  Light's room).&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="3264">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/3199/51"&gt;Kai already mentioned&lt;/a&gt;: Ryuuk said that apples are dry and awful in his Shinigami Realm, and that the ones in the human world are juicy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I also remembered correctly, he let Misa have a bite of one of these apples from the Shinigami Realm and she mentioned that it tasted like sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the second part of your question: It is Ryuuk who loves apples. Another Shinigami, called Sidoh, does love chocolate instead of apples.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4410">&lt;p&gt;I think the writer chose apples because they have both mythical and religious values , like in Adam and Eve's story or Newton and gravity.

</answer></question><question Id="28346" Title="What is the source of Saitama's enormous power?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I have seen only the anime and not the manga. I am utterly curious about the ability and power of Saitama.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the starting episodes, he mentions that he trained very hard and also details his training regime. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, I am still curious to know: is there any mention of the source of his enormous power somewhere in the Manga?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28347">&lt;p&gt;The anime version of One Punch Man is really accurate on regard to the manga so nothing has been revealed in the manga that hasn't in the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you mentionned, in the manga, Saitama followed what he would call a hard training every day :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 sit-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 kilometers every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no air-conditioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yCJUD.png" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yCJUD.png" alt="Saitama training"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Saitama loses his hair, and becomes incredibly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This training &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the source of his power.
Keep in mind that One Punch Man &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/29034/15542"&gt;is intended as a shonen parody&lt;/a&gt; as it is making a parody of its codes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of shonens, training is a main part of the manga. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, in Dragon Ball, the sayans spend years in the &lt;a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hyperbolic Time Chamber&lt;/a&gt; in order to become stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making the training of Saitama so simple (compared to the heroes capacities), One Punch Man is making fun of this Shonen code. Therefore we may not expect any more explanation on what Saitama did in order to become stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28354">&lt;p&gt;Out of universe (aka, in the real world), OPM is definitely a parody of seinen and superhero stories (Power Rangers type stuff, in particular), especially at its inception.  So his power simply &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, and serves to parody the aforementioned genres, as indicated in HamtaroWarrior's answer.  He is just the hero that shows up to vanquish the monster at the very end of the story, only in this case he doesn't do it for Love or Justice or any high ideals like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-universe, though, there have been certain indicators that Saitama's power was obtained by constantly ignoring his limits until eventually he stopped having any.  See Chapter 56 of the webcomic&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, in particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The following is Dr. Genus speaking to Zombieman about why he has given up on the House of Evolution--Saitama made him realize it was futile, as all he would ever do was raise the limits of humanity, which could never compete with something without limits.
 &lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ts2mA.jpg" alt="Dr. Genus relates his experience with Saitama to Zombieman"&gt;
 There are a few panels before and after this one that continue to discuss Saitama's power.  Go read the rest of the chapter for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manga is not quite this far along yet, but it's not terribly far away, and there are some things in the manga that are not in the webcomic (see the image and surround text below, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who is already in decent shape will not be fazed much by Saitama's exercise routine (see HamtaroWarrior's answer).  Their biggest problem, if any, would be the lack of rest days.  However, people in bad shape would take to it much differently. I know in my current couch-potato state I'd have a lot of trouble with jumping straight into that kind of routine, and would likely inflict several long-term injuries on myself from muscle pulls etc.  I've basically done so in the past, actually.  Years ago, when I was a scrawny little nerd who never really exercised, I suddenly decided to try to get some muscles and tried getting 100 push-ups done total throughout the course of a day (2 here, 10 there, etc.).  I pulled a stabilizing muscle around the spine and shoulder blade.  I collapsed face-first onto the floor with a scream when it happened.  For a few days I had limited use of one of my arms and spent most of my time in bed (which was still painful--you never really stop trying to use a stabilizing muscle, thanks to gravity), and I had painful muscle spasms in that area for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saitama was probably in better shape than that when he started, but he wasn't in particularly great shape either.  He was just a lazy, unemployed lay-about, after all.  I would expect him to be pretty firmly on the side of "doing this every day will lead to injuries and a lot of pain" when he started training.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manga adaptation has a sidestory about Saitama's training days that shows him powering himself past intense pain, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7AI2H.jpg" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7AI2H.jpg" alt="No pain no gain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; It's worth noting that the pain was from a bad tooth, not his training.  He was already in his 300th day of training during this story.  Once the tooth was knocked out he felt fine, but before that he's in great pain and continues his workout and saves a few people along the way regardless.  There's another sidestory early on about his training days, but doesn't go into what pain he may have experienced in the early stages.  The anime adaptation of the scene from Hamtaro's answer includes a brief clip showing Saitama in pain while training, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saitama essentially always trained beyond whatever his limits were--if he suffered an injury like I did, he would havewilled himself past it and continued to do 100 pushups and everything else every single day regardless.  For the record, this is a really bad idea in real life.  Please don't do it. Exercise programs and such should be taken seriously when they tell you to consult with a doctor before starting any exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Or you can now see chapter 88 of the manga ("88th Punch: Limiter") for essentially the same exposition.  Be careful if you go looking for this online, though.  This series is notorious for having completely different numberings according to different people/sites, to the extent that some sites still have certain earlier chapters out of order.  I see this chapter in question listed as chapter 135 in one location, for example.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="33812">&lt;p&gt;isn't the explanation of his powers tied to the universe it's self?  the crab monster eating too much crab, the custom car guy becoming a custom car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before he kills the crab guy he even says he wanted to be a hero not a businessman, a hero who could send scumbags like crabman flying with a single punch.  add all that together and then pay attention to the scenes where his eyes glow with intensity and I think you have the answer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now why those powers form from the obsessions/desires I don't know but I think his powers come from his deep desire or obsession with wanting to be a hero + the universes ability to grant powers to people.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36734">&lt;p&gt;I think his powers come from his intense desire to be an all powerful super hero. He wants to be the strongest there is and so he sets himself what he sees as an intense workout program and unlocks his power and assumes it came from his workout regime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see Saitama as a parody not just of manga characters but also as an homage and parody of the Superman from the 60's and 70's. That Superman was so overpowered that he literally could defeat anyone who came against him without breaking a sweat. It became hard for DC comics to have him fight villains because of just how powerful they had made him. They usually had the villain resort to tricks or hoaky scenarios to weaken Superman so he could be fought. He was essentially a god not a hero and he could have beaten anyone with just one punch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the anime you can almost see Superman in the way Saitama moves at times in his costume and the way the cape flutters and moves. Even Saitama's costume is more of an American style costume than a Japanese style.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36981">&lt;p&gt;I would think there is more to his power than just insane training, if you remember genos once said that even saitama doesn't know the source of his power, and according one-sensei(the creator of the series) sitamas power equals to half of the power of big bang that created the universe, I think it's better to wait for sensei to reveal his secret &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;As I remember during Fourth Shinobi war, when Ten-Tails attack the shinobi with Biju-dama, &#10;Shikamaru had some idea to block it with some weak Earth Release that create wall (I don't remember the name of this technique).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So he asked Ino to connect him with some Iwagakure shinobi, (also forgot his name) to teach all of them to use the technique.&#10;After the shinobi teaches them how to perform the technique, all the shinobi use this technique to block the Ten-Tail's Biju-dama.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how were shinobi who never seemed to have Earth Release able to perform this technique?&lt;/strong&gt; &#10;Just like Ino, Shikamaru, and Choji, who I've never seen use Earth Release technique before, were able to perform this Earth Release technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31235">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can people perform some Earth Release without having Earth Release as their chakra nature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because  Earth Chakra Affinity is not the requirement to do the earth release technique but it gives you edge if you have the respective Affinity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if paper test prove you to be have Affinity to Wind Release that doesn't means you can't do non wind released Jutsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nature_transformation#Affinity"&gt;naruto.wikia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shinobi have an easier time learning to create and control chakra
  natures that match their affinity, although even then it may take any
  number of years. Shinobi are not limited to the nature they have an
  affinity for, and it is in fact common for j&#333;nin to have mastered two
  natures. Although it is technically possible to master all five
  natures, it is very rare because of how much of training is involved;
  Madara Uchiha, Hiruzen Sarutobi Hashirama Senju, Tobirama Senju,
  M&#363;, Kakashi Hatake, and Orochimaru are the only shinobi known to have
  done so via normal means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31242">&lt;p&gt;Higher level character can use more than two element, like first, second, third hokage (Because they are the hokages). Uchiha clan people like Madara, Itachi, Sasuke and also Kakashi sensei can use all element because of the copying technique of the sharingan. Other people can also use more than two element but not as good as their own nature element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: using chakra to control or manipulate element is also ninjutsu same like shadow clone jutsu. Sasuke can create max of 3 clone but Naruto can do multi clone jutsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a battle its a matter of life and death.so ninja try to use the weapon that they are trained and mastered with..so only they use only two nature element in which they are strong in.&lt;/p&gt;

Or is it somehow explained why Tifa later doesn't remember Cloud visiting Nibelhelm?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38400">&lt;p&gt;It is known that there are various account on what happened in Nibelheim. The scene where Sephiroth falls into the Mako stream in the reactor was different. In the original FFVII,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Sephiroth stabbed Cloud, but Cloud overpowered Sephiroth, lifted the latter and throw him into the Mako stream below. In another adaptation (forget which one), Sephiroth gladly throw himself into the Mako stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could possibly because the scene in the game was based on Cloud's memory, thus it might be a bit hazy. In other words, he might not remember it correctly (the game version of the story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the 77,777 copies of Advent Pieces: Limited that were released in Japan sold out months in advance of the official release date, Last Order received a negative fan response due to changes in content and presentation from the original Final Fantasy VII game, and because of this, the crew working on Crisis Core avoided recreating certain scenes from Last Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why Tifa doesn't remember that Cloud went to Nibleheim, in the game she was unconscious and the Soldier member that was dispatched to Nibelheim was Sephiroth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;

Or maybe it depends on the series?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44235">&lt;p&gt;You might want to read &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-05-31/.116809" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this article by Justin Sevakis&lt;/a&gt; because it really varies and depends on the type of production committee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Director or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production Committee or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A music publisher (which is part of the production Committee) or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entirely separate business unit within the production Committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anime opening and ending themes are a big deal not only for fans, but
  for the creators, and the companies producing anime. Opening themes
  are a show's "best foot forward," and the staff will usually put quite
  a bit of effort into coming up with an impressive sequence for
  whatever song is chosen. Anime production committees, the group of
  companies putting up money to produce the show, often include a record
  label or music publisher, and so those theme songs are valuable places
  to promote their artists. Ads by Kiosked&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;In some cases, the director will go into the project already wanting a
  certain existing song, or wanting to work with a particular artist to
  compose something specifically for their new project -- regardless of
  whether that artist has anything to do with the companies on the
  production committee. That's how we very occasionally get English
  artists doing opening or closing themes. Other times, the production
  committee will insist on using the songs to push a specific artist,
  and the director just has to deal.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The business of anime vocal tracks is nearly always facilitated by the
  main production company or another business on the production
  committee. Many major anime producers also have affiliated record
  labels -- for example, Bandai Visual owns the record label Lantis,
  while Aniplex itself is a division of Sony Music Japan. At an early
  stage, the production committee has a meeting with the director of the
  anime, and presents him with a pile of pop songs that are in
  production. These songs are at "demo" stage -- meaning, they're not
  done, and usually have a temporary vocal track. The director usually
  just picks a song from that pile and uses it. They might tweak the
  lyrics a little bit to fit the show better. The record label will then
  go back and finish the song with the artist of their choosing, who may
  or may not be a voice actor featured in the show. If a famous
  (expensive) composer is doing the music for the show, they will often
  be asked to contribute the theme songs, as they're likely to be hits
  no matter who sings them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The business of anime songs is a huge one, and operates as a market
  separate from the rest of the Japanese music scene. The selection of
  song and artist is therefore usually a business decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Both say that you cannot use the death note to kill other people whose names aren't written in it. For example, you can't write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;John Doe went to the mall, took out a rifle, shot everyone in the moll dead, then had an heart attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that would mean other people would die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for your specific examples, you cannot write passenger plane crash as the cause of death for a pilot, because that would kill other passengers too. If you wanted, you could write "The pilot disabled the auto-pilot, then had an heart attack". That way, the plane crash has nothing to do with his death, and the plane would still (probably) crash.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7418">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People who name is not written in the note shall not die due someone else that will die due his name being in the Death Note&lt;/em&gt;, both rules can be boiled down to that. That is what the &lt;em&gt;If the death leads to the death of more than the intended&lt;/em&gt; means. As long as the death of the person leads to someone else dead, or the conditions prior death can cause death to others, they will die of a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no contradiction, both rules says the same just in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example you made: both will die in such way that nobody else dies. The surgeon will step back of the table and die, the pilot will die when he's not piloting. Of course, this is mere supposition and details could escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light made some experiments trying to kill in such impossible ways (like a Japanese prisoner died in front of Eiffel Tower), those died on hearts attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7422">&lt;p&gt;Going by the letter of the law,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;logically implies that the surgeon and pilot will die of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably makes the most sense. Were it otherwise, people who know the rules could make themselves (nearly) invincible to the Death Note by having a system by which, if they die, someone else is killed (or kills themself). I say &#8220;nearly&#8221; because the cause of death could be made to say &#8220;die at midnight&#8221; for both people, and that might kill them. Obviously, the Death Note user would have to know both people involved, which could be made near-impossible quite easily[1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, there is the further question of whether &#8220;die at midnight&#8221; would work. One person's name has to be written first, and at the time at which it is written, it is not allowed. However, writing the other person's name after then makes it allowed again. When are the rules evaluated, and by what means? Death Note has the power to predict the future of its victims, but can it predict the future of its own use? This is into the realm of time paradoxes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you could just say that they die of a heart attack. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; [1]For example, if L wanted to make himself invincible to the Death Note, he could have some system by which someone from Wammy's House is killed if he dies. Then, to kill L, a Death Note user needs both L's name and the name and face of that person who gets killed. Even for someone with shinigami eyes, that's virtually impossible to work out.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;There were some gags like Kondou's fake sword etc. that were derived from real life rumors.&lt;br/&gt;&#10;I want to know how much data we actually have about the real life counterparts of the characters in Gintama.&lt;br/&gt;&#10;Are any of their personality traits known to historians?&lt;br/&gt;&#10;How closely do the characters in the anime resemble them?&lt;br/&gt;&#10;How about the historical accuracy of the Shinsengumi command structure?&lt;br/&gt;&#10;And the Joi and Minawarigumi?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6597">&lt;p&gt;Don't know that much so I'll just contribute a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gintama really doesn't stay that true; it's more like taking bits from each real life character's known traits and either using that as inspiration or warping them into something vastly different. As far as Shinsengumi hierarchy, it is loyal- Hijikata was also known as the Demon Vice Commander, Kondo was commander &amp;amp; close with Hijikata, Sougo (Souji) was 1st unit captain. Shinpachi's real life counterpart, however, was part of the Shinsengumi and he obviously is not in Gintama (although he does don the uniform in several occasions xP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little other tidbit: Sougo died of tuberculosis pretty early and he had a sister who outlived him, but that was inverted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;with Mitsuba dying instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Takasugi definitely had a deep bond with Shoyo-sensei's real life counterpart, Shoin, and grieved a lot after Shoin's beheading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mimawarigumi was also considered to be elite, so that part was kept.&lt;/p&gt;

Why did he almost die and yet nothing happened? He was one of the weakest people in this fight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49731">&lt;p&gt;Because that whole arc was filler. Additionally it was a filler arc directed to Gaara, his student and his change. You can say he was the main character, Naruto the side character therefore he was the one who needed to defeat the "bad" guy. If he released the power of the nine-tails I highly doubt Gaara would had the time to shine like he did at the end. Seimei would have been beaten by Naruto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no other reasonable explanation given to us in this arc why he didn't/couldn't use it. You could say it was due to plot. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="44452" Title="What happened to Yahiko's body after he died?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I know that Nagato used Yahiko's body to become 'Pain' but can anyone please tell me why and how he did it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44453">&lt;p&gt;Nagato had an ability called the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Outer_Path" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Outer Path&lt;/a&gt; using which he could revive the dead, transmit chakra to receivers. Using this ability of his, he created his &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Six_Paths_of_Pain" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Six Paths of Pain&lt;/a&gt; technique. He used the technique to embed some chakra rods into certain corpses (including Yahiko's) and transmitted his chakra to the rods to control the bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why he did it, there are several reasons. Nagato got badly injured and damaged during his battle with Hanzo (the same one when Yahiko died). He was unable to move after that. Hanzo was still alive though. Nagato wanted to avenge Yahiko and he also wanted to continue their dream previous dream of peace (although his sense of peace got distorted). So Nagato still had to fight. That is why he created the Six Paths of Pain technique to allow himself to continue fighting and use his Rinnegan abilities. Secondly, he was very fond of Yahiko. He used Yahiko's body to form the strongest Deva Path. In terms of abilities, he was superior to the other paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what happened to Yahiko's body afterwards, well after Nagato died in the Hidden Leaf after the battle with Naruto, Konan retrieved the bodies of both Yahiko and Nagato and buried them in the Hidden Rain Village. And that is where Yahiko's body rests.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="51037" Title="Where to submit anime idea?" Body="&lt;p&gt;If one has come up with an anime manuscript, where or who should you write to if you want to know if the idea is of interest and actually could become something? Or would it be made as a manga first? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, can you like &quot;patent&quot; the manuscript, so that if it actually would be of interest to someone, they don't just change half of the content if they felt like it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="51042">&lt;p&gt;First of all, I doubt they'd look at any scripts not written in Japanese. Second of all, I'm rather doubtful you'd have much success simply pitching an idea to a studio as a person outside the industry. There are, however, many venues to get an idea made into an anime, eventually, but these venues require the person who came up with the idea to produce something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm of course talking about creating some sort of light novel, manga, or comic on your own. These things don't even need to be backed by any sort of publishing company. Japan has thriving communities for posting this sort of original creative works online, such as &lt;a href="https://www.pixiv.net/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Pixiv&lt;/a&gt;. There are quite a few shows now that started life this way: &lt;em&gt;Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rise of a Shield Hero&lt;/em&gt;, to name a couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Japan's TV industry is anything like America's, they are mostly disinterested in ideas. Ideas are a dime a dozen and can be made or broken by their execution. They are much more interested in some sort of proof of concept that the idea will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for preventing changes to your idea, you'd have to make sure to put that in any sort of contract you sign to give them permission to use your work. I would guess that would be extremely difficult to pull off unless your work is proven and popular, such that you have enough power by popularity that your idea is good without changes. I feel like worrying about this though is putting the cart before the horse.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="51045">&lt;p&gt;An article on Anime News Network titled &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2013-10-18" rel="noreferrer"&gt;"How do I get my idea made into an anime?"&lt;/a&gt; should be a good read, at least for me it is, which does not pull any punches on delivering the reality of the anime industry in general. This gave me a general idea of how things really work. Before worrying about whether your ideas will be changed or not, you should worry about whether or not you can even pitch it to studios or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article above mainly revolves on one point: &lt;em&gt;nobody cares about your ideas&lt;/em&gt;. This might be quite rude or something for you but according to the author, who is the founder of Anime News Network, ideas are abundant in the industry. It is a business, so what they care about is what the public wants, so if your idea doesn't fit the current trend, then it will most likely not see the light of day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, to quote from the article, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...even if you are a creative genius, the door to creating an anime is simply not open to you, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don't speak Japanese.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody knows who you are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have no market strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the three main things you should worry about. Of course, as stated in the other answer, you can post your original work online in order to gain audience and popularity. But, you should understand that it is not as easy as you think. So, before worrying about whether you need to make it manga first or whether your original idea won't be changed, &lt;em&gt;try to worry on how to make anime studios see that your idea is worth even becoming an anime at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="51047">&lt;p&gt;I agree with Kai and W. Are's answers and while their answers outline why you should not get your hopes up, I'd like to highlight a few examples of animes that show that this isn't necessarily impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroman" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heroman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reflection_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reflection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the writers, you'll notice that they were both written by Stan Lee, creator of many well known Marvel comics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a second method, I'll bring up &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Yokio" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neo Yokio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an anime that was harshly criticized but shows another possibility: Netflix. Netflix has been investing a lot of money into not just getting animes on its platform, but producing them as well. This one was created by the lead singer of a band, but I'd like to think that Netflix could open up the possibility of Western people getting more involved with Japanese studios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can make your manga and hope it takes off. As Kai mentioned, they have hundreds, probably thousands of ideas they can consider. Outside of being in the industry (and having shown success), the only real way to get your ideas turned into an anime is by your idea being a success beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples in this last category include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radiant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_(film)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Howl's Moving Castle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_Earthsea_(film)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tales from Earthsea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Do note, however, that in the case of the &lt;em&gt;Earthsea&lt;/em&gt;, it was changed enough, for &lt;em&gt;Earthsea&lt;/em&gt;'s author to not really consider it her story anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to &lt;em&gt;Radiant&lt;/em&gt;. This is a comic that takes a lot of inspiration from manga and &lt;a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-08-06/radiant-becomes-1st-french-manga-published-in-japan/.91351" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;thanks to the artist of &lt;em&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it got picked to become a part of the Euromanga Collection. A safe assumption may be that this became an anime thanks to having presumed success in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what this all shows is that it's not about having a good idea, but like W. Are said, giving the studio a reason for them to make it in the first place. And as my examples show, this reason could be you being a person of large influence, getting the right connections or your idea having success in its medium (whether a comic, novel, or perhaps some game).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't get your hopes up with just the manuscript/idea, but do know that it's not outside the realm of possibilities for your work to get an anime adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

My further question is, is it possible that actually all people in BNHA are born with quirk, but got stolen at young age by certain people and made to believe that they are quirkless?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="55953">&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ll wait for the manga to comment on Midoriya, but the other major &#8220;quirkless&#8221; character we are shown is the original One for All. He was All for One&#8217;s brother and thought to have no quirk. However, we soon find out that his quirk was one with no effect - the ability to transfer quirks. It requires the action of All for One forcibly transferring a quirk to him to manifest itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that other quirkless people have similar quirks that don&#8217;t manifest because they don&#8217;t have the right stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this was an ending of a canon episode, I would say they didn't exist in the Naruto universe. But if we take a closer look they are wearing Konoha's clothes and &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Anbu" rel="nofollow"&gt;ANBU's&lt;/a&gt; mask. So these bad guys, I think they are &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Anbu" rel="nofollow"&gt;ANBU's&lt;/a&gt;  ninjas (even though some times they don't wear these outfits) who are "chasing" Sasuke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I noticed that these masks are similar to the &lt;a href="http://http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shinigami_Mask" rel="nofollow"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; that Orochimaru found in the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Uzumaki_Clan%27s_Mask_Storage_Temple" rel="nofollow"&gt;Uzumaki Clan's Mask Storage Temple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the English scanlations the text of that website mentions the resurrection and the return of Kira. Which would mean that Kira existed before and also that his followers are a group which has existed already and believes that Kira now has come back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So did Kira exist even before Raito Yagami started his actions of justice?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think about this? It makes me so confused that I am now trying to find the answer through researching instead of continuing re-reading the manga...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50181">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...the text of that website mentions the resurrection and the return of Kira. Which would mean that Kira existed before and also that his followers are a group which has existed already and believes that Kira now has come back.&lt;/strong&gt; While this might be true, first you have to remember that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much is known regarding the legends, myths, beliefs and religions that existed in the world where &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; is set. All we know is that it is similar to our world. It would therefore be too hasty to immediately conclude that a cult believing in Kira before Light used the Death Note is already in existence. It might or might not be the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, &lt;em&gt;there is no way to verify the existence of Kira's followers or Kira before Light had the Death Note as this was never explained nor explored in the manga&lt;/em&gt;. All we know is that websites talking about Kira as the 'messenger from hell' were suddenly put up after the news picked up on the mysterious killings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;it would not be difficult for people to make up stories&lt;/em&gt; given the imagination we have. Anyone who knows how to make a website with nothing better do can make a website about Kira. Why then do multiple sites talk about Kira if people can make up their own stories? It could be the Kira myth or legend started by one website was found to be popular to most so other websites copied them and the popularity spread even more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, &lt;em&gt;we can't assume yet that these 'followers' existed way before as they could just be a random group of people who have their own motives or objectives&lt;/em&gt;. There's many possible reasons why they would do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Kira, that is, a person who held a Death Note before, could've existed. &lt;em&gt;This is because there are rules in place regarding the ownership and usage of a Death Note whenever it falls in human hands&lt;/em&gt;. If this is the case, then it is also possible that a group of people who knows nothing about the Death Note worshiped this person because of his/her power. It is also possible that this cult survived throughout time and interpreted the mysterious killings as a sign of Kira's return. In order to spread the 'Word' about their religion, they might have put up a website, which could reach more people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, &lt;em&gt;this is all just possibilities so we cannot definitely say nor conclude on anything unless the mangaka would reveal them in the future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, &lt;strong&gt;did Kira (a person who held a Death Note) exist even before Raito Yagami started his actions of justice?&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe yes. Maybe no. But the possibility that he existed is strong due to the presence of the rules regarding humans obtaining Death Note ownership. &lt;strong&gt;Did followers of Kira also exist before?&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe yes. Maybe no. &lt;em&gt;It would be too early to say without evidence that they existed as Kira's 'legend' could just be a made-up story in order to gain more website visitors&lt;/em&gt; or for any other reasons known only to the person or to that group of people who created/started the 'legend'.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="20634" Title="Are Logia types overpowered?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Logia types seem overpowered. Excluding the fact that they are practically invincible to anyone who is not a Haki user (if they can reflexively turn into their element), they have many more advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about how outrageously powerful some of the Logia types could be if they were creative. Almost every other strong character in One Piece (Devil Fruit user or not) is strong because they were either creative as hell, had sheer strength and technique (Zoro), are Haki users with some sort of fighting ability or a combination of all three (of which Luffy is a perfect example). My point is, they all had to be creative or strong and skillful, with Haki to boot (sometimes). Let's be honest, most of the Logia types are so powerful because of their Fruits, I am not denying that their own, personal skill didn't attribute to some of their strength, but let's be real; you've got people like Enel, Kizara, Sakazuki and Ace. Pre-timeskip Ussop would be a formidable opponent with any of these Devil Fruits. It takes a lot of Logia types no physical training, and very little creativity to be a dangerous person to face. If these guys had creativity and didn't completely rely on their Devil Fruits' sheer power, very few people in the OP universe could beat them. Sakazuki could make his opponent's entire stepping ground a field of lava, he could simply make lava &quot;minions&quot; like mannequins made out of lava that could smash into his opponents. I'm sure there are more things he can do, I just made that off the top of my head. Anyways, there seems to be so much they could potentially do, that could wreck their opponent, but they are too comfortable in their abilities to even fathom needing more variety to beat someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Logia can produce limitless amount of their element, this screams overpowered. Someone as formidable as Hawkeye Mihawk could be rendered useless to Ace if he simply chose to send an island-sized fire ball, after all Logias can produce an endless amount of their element. Even if Hawkeye is very fast, Ace could simply use the fire ball if he neared him or if he moved out of sight, and nuke the entire area with it. I doubt even Hawkeye is fast enough to get out of the destruction the attack would cause. Or take another hypothetical situation, Enel verses Shanks. Shanks is one of the strongest characters in One Piece, but if Enel uses his supercharged mantra plus his ability to travel at the speed of sound, he would own Shanks within moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a combo of my two points above, if they can control and manipulate their element in any fashion and use it limitlessly, couldn't they just create a repetitively powerful attack? Okay, some of them would need time for these attacks, but what about the extremely powerful ones that don't? Enel can easily send 200,000 volts into someone. I realize this won't immobilize some of the heavy hitters, but it would slow them the fuck down after he hit them with it for a second time. Kizara could just lock someone in a light cage and shrink it until they combusted inside, Ace could lock someone in a fire sphere and shrink, I am going off on what I read on Logias, that they can manipulate their element in any way, so they don't have to touch it to control it. Why hasn't anyone done this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would bring up other situations that a Logia could have dominated in a split second if they had simply thought of said tactic, but that would take too long. I know some Logia types are more restricted verses others, and don't follow the exact definition, but still most aren't. Logia types could easily destroy islands and kill strong people in moments, it is ridiculous considering Paramecia types and Zoans being on-par with them, some but not many. If we follow the Logia's definition, Logias should be dominating everyone, only challenged by other Logia types. It is the only way (that I know of) in which a weakling or complete idiot can become one of the most dangerous people in OP, maybe the idiot would die, but think about how easily he could decimate a town. And the weakling is worse, they could strategize with power and beat the shit out of anything. I know even the extremely powerful Logias can easily lose, but a lot of that is up to circumstance and they still have a better chance at winning unless they are fresh newbies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seriously, everyone else has to work their ass off to just compete with Logias, and they use almost non of the creative end of their powers and just rely on its sheer destructive nature, and I think Oda knows this. Oda probably knows almost no Logia uses their abilities to its fullest, not even a tenth of its potential, and is still extremely strong. It might be a long running joke.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20640">&lt;p&gt;You are correct, &lt;strong&gt;devil fruit users are inherently overpowered over regular humans&lt;/strong&gt; and within the devil fruit powers their is indeed a power ranking, with Logia users being on top in most cases, unless they fight their natural enemy (Luffy vs Enel). So in a world where not much experienced or strong fighters are available, like East Blue, every devil fruit user will become a ruler and would seem like the most bad-ass person around (Eg: Buggy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering Logia users, I don't understand how you didn't mention Smoker. Smoker is the only Logia user we have seen that completely relied on sheer devil fruit powers. Pre-timeskip he lacked in every other field of combat. Enel and Ace had physical power and creativeness, while the government admirals had Haki to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while I completely agree with you in the four Blues or on Sky islands, I completely disagree with you on this in the New World. &lt;strong&gt;In the New World, having Logia powers means nothing.&lt;/strong&gt; First of all, your examples are not consistent with your statement and basically answer your own question. You say that Logia powers are overpowered regardless of training, which is not true. Considering your example of Ace vs Hawkeye. Ace will never be able to throw a fireball that big, just by eating the fire fruit. He would have to train first to make this happen. He would need to train his power and speed. If he doesn't create the ball fast enough, Hawkeye would just cut Ace in two in no time. Also, even if Ace would have been able to conjure such a fireball, Hawkeye would just cut the ball to pieces and move on. Remember how Fujitora threw a meteor on Law and Doflamingo? They just cut it, like it was nothing. So &lt;strong&gt;unless you are well trained, you will not survive the new world&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless of what powers you might have.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20653">&lt;p&gt;I disagree with your idea that they're overpowered, but I do agree that they're very powerful. Remember, One Piece is not a game, it's a story, and there's no need for balance, so if there were a few characters who were unbeatably strong, they're not necessarily over powered, just unbeatable. I don't think logia users are unbeatable at all though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's repeatedly stated and shown that Logia are the rarest and most powerful devil fruit. Smoker, Aokiji, Crocodile and Kizaru all effortlessly crushed Luffy the first time they met, while simply ignoring his attacks. If you took a random villager from anywhere in One Piece, almost certainly the best way to give them a lot of power very quickly is by feeding them a logia fruit. Coby's transformation took everyone by surprise, but if he had skipped all the hard training and missed his growth spurt and just eaten a logia, other than lucking out with elemental weaknesses, Luffy, the Strawhats and everyone else on Water 7 would have been powerless against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most logias also come with amazing offensive capabilities, as well as almost complete invulnerability to anything other than haki and maybe an elemental weakness. In particular, Enel and the Admirals have very destructive fruits, that aren't complicated or hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they aren't as invincible as you make them out to be. I disagree with both of your examples, I think Mihawk would defeat Ace and Shanks would defeat Enel. I don't think logias work quite how you think, rather than controlling the element, the logia becomes the element, and can then fire it off sometimes. I don't think any character has been shown to control their element after it's left their body, so I don't think Ace or Kizaru can do the kind of attacks you say they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if they could, again it's not that simple. If Ace hits you with a fireball, your burnt but there's no guarantee that you're defeated. Many One Piece characters are very tough, and some have such good haki and reflexes that they're almost impossible to hit. Ace tried to kill Whitebeard many times and never left a scratch on him. If Ace were to hit Mihawk with a big Fireball, and Mihawk ran through the fire and gave him a haki-imbued slash, I suspect Ace would be in much worse condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory logias can produce an infinite amout of their element, but not necessarily all at once. I doubt Ace could flip out and burn a whole island/the world on a whim, in the same way Law claims that having a room up for too long exhausts him, I suspect logias work the same way. Enel wanted to destroy Skypiea, but rather than just point his finger and blast it away, he had to use his maxim to do complicated things with storm clouds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for your final point, Enel and Kizaru can travel at very high speeds, probably much faster than any character relying on their legs to travel like Shanks or Mihawk. But they can't necessarily think and react at those speeds, if Enel turns to lightning and shoots over to hit you, but you predict it with your haki and dodge, I don't think he could change course and hit you. As well, the transition from human to light/lightning form is not instantaneous, with Kizaru having repeatedly been stopped once he started trying to beam himself somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in answer to your question, I think yes, logia fruits are very powerful, but no they aren't everything. You can't just eat a logia and wait around to be made a yonko/admiral.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22335">&lt;p&gt;Yes, at first it looks like it's overpower and we think nothing can stop him. But remember, how powerful a devil fruit's power can be is based on how powerful the person who ate it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think Luffy's powers are great because he is rubber so you can punch anyone as hard as you can without worrying you will hurt your arms, but remember he cant even beat Sabo or Ace at first, simply because two of them are stronger than he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is when Smoker easily caught Luffy in Logue Town or in the Marineford War arc, which is because he too is stronger than Luffy. But in the Punk Hazard Arc, Smoker loses twice when he fights Law and Vergo, because he is far weaker than Law who has the Paramecia power and Vergo who hasn't eaten any devil fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are some characters who relied on his devil fruit so much like Enel and Caribou, but according to Pekoms, anyone that thinks they're superior just because they eat logia fruit can't survive on New World.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="44680">&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the Logia devil fruits are not the rarest anymore. The Mythical Zoan are. (Only two mythical Zoan confirmed, Marco's Devil fruit and Sengoku's Hito Hito no Mi: Model Daibutsu, versus 11 Logia Devil Fruits confirmed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there's a reason why Oda added Haki and Rokushiki. Everybody can learn Busoshoku and Kenbushoku Haki to the point that all Vice-Admirals can use both Colors, and any person that trains hard can learn Rokushiki (a good amount of Vice-Admirals complement their fighting styles with Rokushiki techniques, hell even Coby can use Soru and Rankyaku).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Logia devil fruit user has to train a lot in order to properly harness his power (remember that Luffy had a lot of problems with controlling his body after he ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi) and to reflexively turn into the respective element (although Kenbushoku Haki may help in this regard), and then train and improve both his Busoshoku Haki in order to be able to defend against Haki users and his Kenbushoku in order to be able to predict incoming attacks. This takes a lot of training time. At the same time, a regular rank-and-file marine can train himself to become the next Garp in terms of raw power and strength of Haki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, your statement holds true if we're talking about the Paradise part of the Grand Line, because in the New World, Haki is common knowledge. (Hell, even Haoshoku Haki is way more common in the New World than in Paradise: Dolflamingo, Don Chinjao, Big Mom and Charlotte Katakuri, all have it so far.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, Logia Devil Fruits' seemingly overpowered-ness is balanced by the common knowledge of Haki.&lt;/p&gt;

Shinto is a philosophy indigenous to Japan, and therefore thematically related to loyalty &amp;amp; nationality, like Mugen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jin's main fish is colored like a koi, the Japanese word for "carp". Koi are obviously symbols of Japanese culture, associated with love &amp;amp; friendship. Aquatic life is from the ocean, the realm of the storm god Susanoo, Amaterasu's sibling &amp;amp; counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the story of Amaterasu &amp;amp; Susanoo, as it has obvious parallels to Mugen &amp;amp; Jin's relationship. Interestingly enough, they have a third sibling, Tsukuyomi, the god of the moon, who acted as a foil, kind of like Fuu.

Body="&lt;p&gt;If one were to use Izanagi or Izanami, the light in that eye would be lost forever. When Tobi used it, he replaced the eye with a Rinnegan.

Use of Izanagi or Izanami causes the eye to permanently lose its light, but it does not damage the optic nerve that connects to the eye. If it did, Tobi should not have been able to transplant even a Rinnegan there. For that matter, he could have transplanted a Byakugan or an ordinary eye there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobi wanted the Rinnegan for its own sake, not because he had to somehow replace "permanently closed" Sharingan eye. In fact, he wouldn't have known beforehand that he would be forced to use Izanagi in the fight with Konan.

Is this normal for people in that time period?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="123">&lt;p&gt;&#65374;&#12372;&#12374;&#12427; is commonly known as a more polite way of ending a sentence, but it's also common in historical dramas because it is a bit archaic-sounding. ANN has an entry on this in their lexicon &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=36" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A more detailed analysis of Kenshin's speech patterns can be found &lt;a href="http://www.jessdoor.com/anime/seissha.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: It was pointed out in chat that there's a closely related question with a really good answer on the &lt;a href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/653/if-i-wanted-to-sound-more-like-a-samurai-what-words-and-phrases-should-i-learn/673#673"&gt;Japanese  Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="22460">&lt;h2&gt;Why does Himura always end almost every sentence with gozaru in this show?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;express his self-abasement,&lt;/strong&gt; modesty, and serving attitude.  This is the &lt;strong&gt;persona he adopted in the Meiji era&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;em&gt;rurouni&lt;/em&gt; (wandering samurai).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenshin's usage&lt;/strong&gt; of this speech pattern is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; for the intent of marking the series as historical fiction&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is evidenced by the fact that &lt;strong&gt;none of the other characters&lt;/strong&gt; in the series speak this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;Kenshin did not use&#12300;&#12391;&#12372;&#12374;&#12427;&#12301;(&lt;em&gt;de gozaru&lt;/em&gt;) when he was younger&lt;/strong&gt; (before his &lt;em&gt;rurouni&lt;/em&gt; phase of life), and &lt;strong&gt;when he flips into &lt;em&gt;hitokiri battousai&lt;/em&gt; mode&lt;/strong&gt; within the series proper (when his eyes are yellow), &lt;strong&gt;he does not use this copula verb form&lt;/strong&gt; because, in &lt;em&gt;battousai&lt;/em&gt; mode, he does not have a meek personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stark difference between his speech patterns and everyone else's emphasizes &lt;strong&gt;Kenshin's personal, intentional choice to use this style of speech&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than the &lt;em&gt;mangaka&lt;/em&gt;, Nobuhiro Watsuki, intending this phrasing to be representative of the era, it highlights Kenshin's now humble personality and that he is a bit different from the new norms of his time period (in the same way that he persists in carrying a sword and sheath, still wears &lt;em&gt;hakama&lt;/em&gt; rather than pants, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;De gozaru&lt;/em&gt;" is part of Kenshin's response to realizing that he was very mistaken in his previous actions and convictions during the Bakumatsu period. In combination, he also uses &#12300;&#25305;&#32773;&#12301; (&lt;em&gt;sessha&lt;/em&gt;), which is a &#35609;&#35698;&#35486; (&lt;em&gt;kenjougo&lt;/em&gt; = humble language) word. &lt;em&gt;Kenjougo&lt;/em&gt; is a lowering of the speaker in comparison to the person/people being spoken to. As seen in thejapanesepage.com's &lt;a href="http://thejapanesepage.com/grammar/more_polite_language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article on &lt;em&gt;keigo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (polite speech), &lt;em&gt;kenjougo&lt;/em&gt; is (to this day) employed in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;referring to oneself or one's family members and (usually) &lt;strong&gt;speaking to someone higher up&lt;/strong&gt; in social rank, position or some other criteria for determining status. However even some people with high positions may choose to use the humble form with those under him/her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.japaneseprofessor.com/reference/grammar/conjugations-of-the-japanese-copula/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kenneth Hanson&lt;/a&gt; explains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A copula is a word meaning &#8220;to be&#8221;, and is used to predicate a sentence. . . . &lt;strong&gt;The copula takes three basic forms&lt;/strong&gt; in standard speech: the plain form &#12384; (da) in informal speech, the polite form &#12391;&#12377; (desu) in formal speech, and &#12391;&#12372;&#12374;&#12356;&#12414;&#12377; (de gozaimasu) in honorific speech. In the case of the last form, the same word is used both for respectful and humble speech; unlike other components of keigo, de gozaimasu is neutral to who the subject is. . . . In truth, things are a little more complicated than this. . . . &lt;strong&gt;de gozaru is the honorific form of de aru&lt;/strong&gt;, but with keigo the polite form of an honorific verb is almost always used, so we get de gozaimasu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is this normal for people in that time period?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/users/153/boaz-yaniv"&gt;Boaz Yaniv&lt;/a&gt; explains on the &lt;a href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/653/if-i-wanted-to-sound-more-like-a-samurai-what-words-and-phrases-should-i-learn/673#673"&gt;Japanese Language SE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the stereotypical Samurai speech in Jidaigeki is actually based on the &lt;strong&gt;Edo dialect of late Edo period&lt;/strong&gt;. Many of the mannerisms you'd find in this speech do not specifically represent Samurai, but rather a typical resident of Edo in that particular time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Edo era lasted from 1603 to &lt;strong&gt;1868&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; however, Japan had been forcibly opened to the outside world by Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#8217;s black ships back in &lt;strong&gt;1853&lt;/strong&gt; (15 years before Edo officially ended).  The Convention of Kanagawa was signed with Perry in &lt;strong&gt;1854&lt;/strong&gt;, with three more international treaties of Amity and Commerce following in 1858 (the shogunate was successfully disbanded in 1867, the Boshin civil war raged for over a year as loyalists attempted to restore the shogunate to power, and the Republic of Ezo, a secessionist state located in what is now Hokkaido prefecture, stayed afloat for half of 1869 before being crushed by Japan&#8217;s imperial forces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to speech patterns of the late Edo period, Meiji is when Japan's first generation of young men attended college, learned English, learned how to eat with fork and spoon, and went to study abroad. &lt;strong&gt;Japan was very keen to portray itself as rapidly modernizing so as not to be colonized by other nations&lt;/strong&gt; (approximately when Perry opened Japan to the West, the British Empire took control of India; America annexed Alaska and Hawaii; and the Berlin Conference of 1884 set the Scramble for Africa into motion. Historical figure Nitobe Inazo explained that "[t]he Union Jack was firmly planted in India and was moving eastward to Singapore, Hong-Kong, and there was some probability of it marching on to China.  Why not to Japan too?  The French Tricolor was also seen floating over Cambodia, Annam, and Tonkin, and nobody could tell how far north or east it would fly.  More alarming than these, the Muscovite Power, like a huge avalanche, was steadily descending southwards from its Siberian steppes, crushing everything on its way."  Inazo Nitobe, &#8220;Lectures on Japan: The Manchurian Question and Sino-Japanese Relations,&#8221; in &lt;em&gt;Lectures on Japan: An Outline of the Development of the Japanese People and Their Culture&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 227&#8211;29).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="34386" Title="Akito's motivation?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the anime Fruits Basket, what was Akito's motivation behind allowing Tohru to live with Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did he hope that Tohru would reject them, thinking that no normal person would ever care for them, and heartbroken, they'd all return to his side at the main house? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34469">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This answer is full of unmarked spoilers to the manga and the anime. The anime ends maybe halfway through the manga, and further on in the manga it is revealed that Akito is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; a girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://fruitsbasket.wikia.com/wiki/Akito_Sohma" rel="nofollow"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After Yuki left the Main House to live with Shigure, Akito's mother Ren commented that the cursed Sohmas were abandoning Akito, just as Ren always predicted they would. Akito denied this and claimed they would all come back to her because of their inseparable Zodiac bonds. She and Ren made a dare in which Akito was to allow the cursed Sohmas to form bonds with "outsiders" to test whether they would return to Akito's side. If they did not return, Akito would have to bow before Ren then leave the Sohma family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ren is not fully sane. Her obsession with Akira and jealousy of Akito's relationship to him caused her to emotionally abuse Akito. There's a whole backstory on why Ren is so abusive, but I don't think it's entirely relevant. Due to Ren's emotional abuse focusing primarily on Akito being unloved, Akito's deepest fear is that she ends up alone, with everyone having left her. She recognises the power, as God, she has over the cursed Sohmas so she abuses that to ensure they never break the curse and presumably leave her. When Kureno, the Rooster, breaks free of his curse (about ten years before the events of Fruits Basket), Akito confines him to the Main House for fear of him abandoning her. She even goes so far as to attempt to keep him there through seduction, and although Kureno does not fall in love with her, he does have sex with her. At the same time, however, Akito pursued a relationship with Shigure, whom she truely loves. Shigure recipricated those feelings, but Ren intervened and convinced Shigure to sleep with Ren in revenge for Akito's sex with Kureno. When Akito discovered this, she exiled Shigure from the Main House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, Hatsuharu convinces Shigure to allow Yuki to stay at his house due to the extreme emotional abuse Akito inflicts on Yuki. Kyo also winds up staying at Shigure's as he is forbidden from staying in the Main House. Ren continues to torture Akito by declaring that all three's departure suggests that they are abandoning her, and, since Ren sucessfully convinced her that, given the choice, the cursed Sohmas would rather abandon Akito than support her, Akito pitifully clings to the belief that the Zodiac bonds will force them to return. In defiance of her mother, Akito allows Tohru to stay to prove Ren wrong, and reaffirm Akito's conviction that the Zodiac bonds trump all.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the first two seasons of &lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;, dates are mentioned with &quot;a.t.b.&quot;. I took this screenshot from first episode of season one:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZjkw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;2010 a.t.b., August 10th&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, in &lt;em&gt;Code Geass: Akito the Exiled&lt;/em&gt;, dates are mentioned as R.Y. (Revolution Year). This is a screenshot from the &lt;em&gt;Akito the Exiled&lt;/em&gt; trailer:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgvX0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Revolution Year 228; EU - Europe United Alliance&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, first question: &lt;strong&gt;What does a.t.b. stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10;And, also: &lt;strong&gt;How can we convert between a.t.b. and R.Y.? Which Revolution Year would 2010 a.t.b. be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4815">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does a.t.b. stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stands for "Ascension Throne Britannia", named after the "date the first Celtic super-king, Eowyn, was elected by the united British tribes to battle Rome, becoming the first member of the modern Britannian imperial family."&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/World_History"&gt;{1}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 55 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"&gt;B.C.&lt;/a&gt; is equivalent to 1 a.t.b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we convert between a.t.b. and R.Y.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Revolution Year system (used by the EU in &lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;) is based on the French Revolution (start date) of 1789 A.D.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"&gt;{2}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/European_Union#Akito_Worldview_Columns"&gt;{3}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since 55 B.C. is 1 a.t.b., we can figure out the actual conversion formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;0 R.Y. = 1789 A.D. = 1845 a.t.b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a simple conversion between a.t.b. and R.Y., just some simple math:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;R.Y. = a.t.b. - 1845&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Revolution Year would 2010 a.t.b. be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the conversion above, a.t.b. 2010 is equivalent to R.Y 165.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6744">&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the second episode of Akito the Exiled, the following is said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Revolution Year 228. It has been seven years since the Empire of Britannia invaded Japan and renamed it Area 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the invasion of Japan happened in 2010 a.t.b, it can be deduced that the offset, at least in the time frame of the series, between a.t.b and R.T is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2010 + 7 - 228 = 1789
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it appears that R.Y. 0 would correspond to 1789 a.t.b.&lt;/p&gt;

I think the most popular example for this kind of character is Ash Ketchum from Pokemon and Nobita and his friends from Doraemon. (Yes, I do realize that both anime are for kids - I don't remember any other example that the character never grows up for a long time). However, most characters from long-running anime that I know of always grow up, like those from Dragonball, One Piece, Naruto, Fairy Tail, and Shin-chan. (The last one I mentioned has similar traits to Pokemon and Doraemon, although I'm not sure Shin-chan is for kids). Any reason behind this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6872">&lt;p&gt;The creator of Pokemon wanted children watching the show to be able to relate to the main protagonist, Ash/Satoshi (personally I believe the protagonist is Pikachu).
Keeping the character around the age of ten is a good way to get kids that will be this age (ten) soon to watch the show.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="24005">&lt;p&gt;A possibility is that the time leap between episodes is short. In Pokemon's case, there are about 887 episodes, but the time span between the episodes is never revealed. If each episode occurred back to back, only about 2.43 years has passed since the first episode occurred, which is a short time for some people to physically change. Another example is Detective Conan, which currently has 787 episodes. If each episode occurred back to back, about 2.15 years has passed. This is relatively short, especially for grade-schoolers, to change physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple exception, and one of them is Doraemon. Doraemon has more than 2000 episodes and even if each episode occurred back to back, more than 6 years has passed. For ones like these, the only probable explanation is that the author wanted to keep the characters young to appeal to younger audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

Repeated syllables (like in the episode 6 preview shown above) are pronounced the same as far as I can tell, which seems to support this theory.

It was not until episode 55, &lt;em&gt;Wind&lt;/em&gt;, of &lt;em&gt;Naruto Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; that Kakashi explained chakra forms and types to Naruto. This is when Kakashi helps Naruto identify what type of chakra he possesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did this with a special kind of paper called Litmus paper, which is sensitive to chakra. When a ninja focuses their chakra through it, different things will happen to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MabS5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MabS5.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he focused his chakra into the Litmus paper it split in half, identifying his chakra as wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same same episode, we see that Kakashi's chakra nature is lightning because of the way the paper wrinkles. The fact that Kakashi can use (and has mastered) more than one chakra nature at this point shows us that the paper will only react in one way. So we can conclude that his original nature, in the Naruto series, was wind; his chakra nature was just not known until that point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franky was actually created with seiyu Kazuki Yao in mind after Eiichiro Oda (the mangaka) heard the voice actor's performance as Jango and Bon Clay, however it is likely that Franky is based on Pop-eye.

&lt;p&gt;I will speculate Franky more as Arnold Schwarzenegger for he is a cyborg related to 'The Terminator' and he always wears underwear posing like a body builder. Arnold was a body builder and had won many titles; if you search on Google for some pictures of this guy you will see him posing with underwear. There are surely more clues with regard to that matter like his real name 'Cutty Flam' and the star tattoo that he has on his elbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darn, I almost see Duke Nukem in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zorro, the name says it all. Aka Sero, Don Diego de la Vega, he always wears his bandana when he fights seriously which makes him look like a pirate, but it also covers his eyes making him look like Sero when he is not wearing his hat. When it comes to sword play, he uses one-sword style which is unmatched because of his dexterity. It is like fighting someone using 3 swords and the 'Z' of his trademark makes it 3 slashes. They say Sero is a fox with three tails related to Zorro Santoryu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Usopp and Chopper you are correct, I am curious to know about the rest. Remember One Piece is supposed to be funny, this is why the personality differs from the real protagonist, but when they are serious in a fight it turns them into the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="13477" Title="Steins;Gate, Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes, and Occultic;Nine naming convention with semicolon?" Body="&lt;p&gt;The following anime share the use of the semicolon as part of their names:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steins;Gate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaos;Head&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robotics;Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Occultic;Nine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What is the reason for using the semicolon within the titles of these anime?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13480">&lt;p&gt;The best answer that I could make out myself for the use of the semi-colon in the names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The semicolon in the names are used as a form of "pertaining to," however "not in possession of." Meaning--for example--"Steins" is related to "Gate" however, "Steins" is not in possession of "Gate." (This applies to the other two names as well.) We can see this because "Steins" does not make use of an apostrophe, which denotes possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this by also rewording the titles of the anime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gate of Steins&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Head of Chaos&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Notes of Robotics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we see that "Steins," "Chaos," and "Robotics" all are related to the the preceding words in the reworded titles, just the same as if we made use of the semi-colon instead of, "of," in the original titles.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36628">&lt;p&gt;Oh no, I'm two years late to the discussion. While browsing on Steam, I came across STEINS;GATE and wondered why the semicolon was used in the title. I started reading reviews of the game but didn't find anything and so I Googled it and came to this page. From the reviews, STEINS;GATE sounds like an excellent visual novel, and so my comments here shouldn't reflect on the creators of the game; they are quite talented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting if the use of the semicolon here is an example of how World English is evolving. If all through the continent of Asia, for example, the semicolon in English has come to mean "related to but not possessed by" then I'd understand its use here. If not, however, then this is just a typographical error. I've had English professors whose hair would stand on end if they saw the semicolon used this way. If a student submitted a paper with a proper noun styled like this, those professors would circle the semicolon vigorously in red and make a brief comment with a lot of exclamation marks. That would be an overreaction, of course, but you can see that the construction is so odd that even I'm motivated to comment on it, two years late even. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FatalSleep provided a very clearly written answer, but in contemporary Standard English, the semicolon isn't used to connect nouns unless they are in a complex series. If you have a series of three or more elements, and one or more of those elements have three or more elements of their own, 1) a semicolon is used to separate the main elements in the series, to avoid confusion. The only other time a semicolon can be used correctly in Standard English is 2) to connect two independent clauses with no conjunction when they aren't serial clauses. The last sentence of my first paragraph is an example of that. These are the only two correct uses of the semicolon. The semicolon isn't a soft colon, even though that's what the name looks like; it's a hard comma, with only two uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contemporary usage, STEINS:GATE is more familiar and would've been a better choice. The irony is that, because STEINS modifies the noun GATE, nothing is needed to show that they are connected. STEINS GATE is referring to only one gate, closely associated with STEINS but not possessed by them because there's no apostrophe. A variation of that would be SteinsGate, using camel caps, to indicate the same thing. Even STEINS-GATE would've been better than STEINS;GATE. But they've also created CHAOS;HEAD and ROBOTICS;NOTES. My professors would've burst a blood vessel over those. What were the game creators thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If lots of people start using a semicolon to connect words because they think it looks cool, then eventually it will become standard usage in World English and no one will complain. Eventually. Users of Standard English will wonder why, but they'll just shrug and say "Like, whatever."&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In ep. 23, after both protagonists fall into the cold water below the bridge (astonishingly, without breaking any body parts in such shallow waters), Ryuji proposes to Taiga, and tells her that they could stay on the run until he is 18, and then marry.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7114a.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;US embassy orientation about Japanese marriage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;Article 731 to 737 of the Japanese Civil Code stipulates the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;ul&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;The male partner must be 18 years of age or older and the female partner must be 16 years of age or older.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;In addition, for Americans, you must be able to legally marry in your home state; if the legal age of marriage at home is 18, you cannot marry earlier than that in Japan.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;A woman cannot get married within six months of the dissolution of her previous marriage. According to Japanese law, this is to avoid confusion as to the identification of a child's father if a birth occurs close in time to the end of the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;Most people related by blood, by adoption or through other marriages cannot get married in Japan.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;li&gt;A person who is under 20 years of age cannot get married in Japan without a parent's approval.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last line means that they would have to keep on the run for two more years if they were to marry without consent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is it supposed to illustrate a blunder caused by a lack of information with the teenage characters, or there was a way for them to get married without parental consent?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23535">&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, they were &lt;a href="http://tora-dora.wikia.com/wiki/Taiga_Aisaka" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;going to live with Ryuji's grandparents&lt;/a&gt; -(Wikia Article -Valentine's Day Arc third paragraph) - who would then act as legal guardians for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ryuuji and Taiga pack for a long trip; but when Ryuuji spies Yasuko's note he realizes she had run away, like a child, and he convinces Taiga that they should visit his grandparents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supposing the laws are similar here, parental consent could be substituted by consent of a legal guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39386">&lt;p&gt;So I'll admit it's taken a long time to research this question, but my conclusion is thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;They were teenagers in love, unaware that they couldn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; elope.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My believe is that they could &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have directly eloped, and would have to be on the run for an additional two years to satisfy Japanese law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, but the reality of figuring out how to survive while living like that - a subject touched on towards the end of the series, but not really fully fleshed out - would've likely proven too hard for them to survive.  Without any steady source of income, and even with a place to stay, their chances of surviving without a larger support network (yes, besides their friends) would've been very, very small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are loopholes to this scenario.  That is, there are reasonable scenarios which could have occurred that would've cleared these hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note:  &lt;strong&gt;these are conjectural, and based &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on the evidence we have at hand.&lt;/strong&gt;  I wouldn't say at all that this would occur; I wanted to explore the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with Taiga, we can see that there are cracks in her relationships with her parents.  At this point, we know this because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Taiga initially stormed off because her mother is pregnant, and will be introducing a new child into her family.  Taiga takes umbrage to this, and would rather not be in her mother's family.  Her father has already left town and would not be in a position to be a "parent" of any kind to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that, and how their relationship had progressed at that point, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be seen that Taiga could have received approval from her mother to get married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Note that in the last episode, a voice mail left by Taiga's mom which sounded like furious resignation could've cleared the path to her becoming emancipated (as I as an American understand it), and would've been the start of her being able to get married before 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Ryuuji's side, his perspective is a lot less clear due to his familial circumstances, but there is an angle that could have been exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; After he ran off with Taiga, Yasuko had started to see Ryuuji as more of an independent man.  Even though her burning wish was to see her son succeed academically - a part in which she failed and genuinely wanted her son &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to fail - after his brief but sharp rebuke, she could be seen as respecting Ryuuji just a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Yasuko was heartbroken, it could be conjectured that Ryuuji could've asked her for her approval...after she was found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Note that Yasuko cut off all communication with the world, essentially, after Ryuuji ran off.  The only way that anyone got in touch with her was by telling her that Ryuuji was with her parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would've opened up the dialogue somewhat, and &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have allowed Ryuuji to gain his mother's permission to marry.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="2283" Title="Who died first? H&#228;nsel or Gretel?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Black Lagoon, H&#228;nsel and Gretel are deranged children suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EWSb0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each of them have distinct personalities, but from time to time, they switch places with each other - clothing, weapons, voice, personality, and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In episode 15, both of them are killed. H&#228;nsel (the boy) dies in front of Balalaika after being shot by a sniper. Gretel (the girl) dies at the end of the episode when a hitman headshots her from behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But do we know if they were themselves when they were killed? Did H&#228;nsel really die first?&lt;br&gt;Or were they switched? Are there any clues anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2324">&lt;p&gt;While Gretel is on the boat talking to Rock, she says that it's OK that Hansel is dead because they are always together. She takes off her wig and her voice changes into the lower Hansel voice, then puts the wig back on and is back to Gretel's voice. So they are indistinguishable from their appearance and voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only hint we get is right before Rock leaves the cabin Gretel is in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tzDe.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gretel takes off her underwear and lifts up her skirt giving Rock a "view" as a "gift". Rock is shocked and leaves the room disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is really "Hansel" and Rock is shocked because Gretel is actually a boy. &lt;em&gt;Gretel died first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is really "Gretel" and Rock is shocked because he's being flashed by a little girl. &lt;em&gt;Hansel died first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rock isn't shocked by whether she's a boy or girl but that she/he thinks flashing him is supposed to be a "gift". &lt;em&gt;Inconclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;em&gt;inconclusive&lt;/em&gt; possibilities could be that her genitalia was mutilated from all the snuff films, or even she is a hermaphrodite. But it's most likely that we never know who was killed first. They are always interchanging/swapping, it's likely neither of them knows whether they are Hansel or Gretel anymore, so that facet of their character would be undermined if we were to know who was who.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="11182">&lt;p&gt;I think Hansel died first because it's possible that Hansel might have just been a girl the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible that Hansel and Gretel suffer from gender confusion or multi-personality disorder, especially after Gretel suddenly took her/his wig off and started to sound like Hansel, and also when Gretel showed of her/his Genitals.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="11548">&lt;p&gt;Gretel may have died second. After Rock leaves the room and stands on top the boat, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They turned HER into a monster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't seem to sound that he wasn't really as disgusted as when he was shown Gretel's genitals. Rock's reaction could've been worse if the Gretel in the boat was male, so in my opinion Hansel died first and Gretel died second.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13204">&lt;p&gt;I believe Gretel died second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since yes, Rock did refer to her as a "she" when she revealed her gift. And people have theories it's a dismembered.. gift in attempts to be female as well. Or because of her past- being raped and filmed, she thought that offering herself will make him feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14071">&lt;p&gt;Hansel died first because in episode 14, they took the Russian man from the bar to the car. "Hansel" (in reality it was Gretel who carried him) carried him and said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He is too heavy; help me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He (she) said it because "he" is a girl and the man was to heavy for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real Hansel said to the real Gretel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NOW you are the boy; you have to carry him&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, they change again and the last one in the hotel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the real Hansel died as Hansel (himself) and the real Gretel died as Gretel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rock was shocked because Gretel thought it's a gift to give him a view (or because Gretel has some injuries there (because the people who make the videos hurt the kids or something like that)).&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28406">&lt;p&gt;Gretel died second, Hansel died first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you watch episode 15 "Swan Song at Dawn", after Gretel exposed herself to him, he continued to refer to the child as a female, stating, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DAMNIT! DAMNIT! WHY? Why did this have to happen? Everyone in 'her' life betrayed her. They turned her into a monster, they turned her into a fuck'n monster. Goddamnit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benny steps in and says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rock, sometimes its best to look the other way, you have to do that to survive here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rock grips Benny and pins him against the ship and says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then Benny says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You'll what?! Adopt her? Forget it; you can't just undo what's been done to her. If only someone had shown them a little kindness they might have gone to school made friends and lived happily ever after. Who knows right? But that didn't happen, now did it? I'm sorry; but stories like this don't have happy endings, Rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this dialog, I would think that if the child had been the male sibling, Rock would've referred to them as such.&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, "Farewell, Yukichi" (&#12300;&#12373;&#12425;&#12400;&#35565;&#21513;&#12301;) is the defining quote of Kyousuke Natsume from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Busters!" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Busters!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another visual novel written by Jun Maeda.&lt;/p&gt;

Yui changed her role in the band from support to lead after Iwasawa left the Afterlife World.

If you turn up the volume just after Yuri throws her second tantrum, you can also hear a 'mysterious' voice saying "what's with her?" (&#12300;&#12394;&#12435;&#12384;&#12371;&#12356;&#12388;&#12301;).

&lt;p&gt;In this panel, Yusa is explaining the term "marriage hunting" (&lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A%E6%B4%BB%E5%8B%95" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&#23130;&#27963;&lt;/a&gt;) to Hinata. The true meaning of &#29483;&#22823;&#38520; still eludes me, but if I were to fashion a guess, it would at least be somewhat related to marriage hunting, which reminds me of the missed opportunity in this episode for Otonashi to do, I mean, to become closer to Kanade, and the fact that the 'marriage hunting' was initiated by Naoi on behalf of Otonashi, too!&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="55798" Title="Did the beast titan walk all the way to the wall, and can the Beast Titan run?" Body="&lt;p&gt;When we saw the first glimpse of the Beast Titan in season 2, he was walking slow, at least compared to titans that we have seen. It seems unlikely that he would transform just to simply walk at a slow pace. It would be much faster if he ran to the wall, but I am not sure if he can actually run. His arms are very long in comparison to his body size. When he stands up he touches his ankles. With all of these facts together I am not sure if he simply walked or ran (or if he can for that matter).    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="55803">&lt;p&gt;The way he reached there was by help of cart titan.

Body="&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to get the Rinnegan if you are not in the Senju or Uchiha clan (including branch clans such as Uzumaki) and inject Senju and Uchiha DNA into yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="18617">&lt;p&gt;To awaken the Rinnegan, it's not enough to be a Senju with Uchiha eyes or vice versa, you must be Indra's successor that obtained chakra from Asura's successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successor does not necessarily come directly from the Senju clan, as Naruto, who is an Uzumaki, is a successor. However, Indra's successor is always an Uchiha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, no. It's not possible to do what you describe.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="18670">&lt;p&gt;My answer is yes, but only by nature of technicality. This method is possible, though highly improbable. It may in fact not have a prayer of working at all. However, let me lay out this plan for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we know that creatures like the Tailed Beasts can be sealed within a host body. The host body then can gain the power of the sealed Tailed Beast. We also know that a human soul can be sealed, though whether it is possible to seal another person inside one's self is not explicitly shown (to my knowledge anyway). We have, however, seen the souls of all the first four Hokage being sealed within the Shinigami as part of the Reaper Death Seal. Putting these elements together, I think it would be safe to assume it is at least possible for one person to use a similar sealing method as used on the Tailed Beasts to incorporate another human being into themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; We also know from Obito and Kakashi that the entire chakra and essence of a person's Kekkei Genkai can be placed into another person's body. This is what allowed Kakashi to make use of the full power of Obito's eyes as well as Susanoo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Now, for the final piece of information before this can all come together, we know that the requirements for activating the Rinnegan, which, as explained by Black Zetsu, is to bring together the chakra of Indra and Asura, thus giving you the chakra of their father. Therefore, if you could actually seal whoever the current successor of Indra and Asura are, then in this given hypothetical scenario, a third party could in fact gain a Rinnegan.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 In no shape or form would I consider this natural, and I'm sure there are a lot of questionable morals involved with the entire idea, but through this strange course of action or something similar in nature, I believe it is possible to gain the Rinnegan even as someone who was not born with either Indra or Asura's chakra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, it's a crazy, loophole kind of a way of going about it. But hey, you asked for possibility, not plausibility or even likelihood. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="35833">&lt;p&gt;No it is not possible, forces unknown decide who gets the rinnegan and when, only in times of great discord is it possible for tose who can attain great power to change the world may by chance awaken their rinnegan, such as Madara and Nagato&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="48715">&lt;p&gt;No it&#8217;s not possible, Orochimaru probably tried countless of times to replicate the scenario, but only Madara got lucky; Madara, while being alive, was able to unlock the Rinnegan near his death.. He was reincarnation of Indra was well...and probably had the purest connection to Indra next to Sasuke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know in order to get Rinnegan, the person must have Indra and Ashura cells (not just Uchiha and Senju, because the person needs to be more related to Hagoromo), But it&#8217;s extremely hard to match the right genes. Madara, being the reincarnation of Indra and Hashirama being reincarnation Ashura is your best chance...other Uchihas will not even come close. After that, it will take years to even unlock it, and who know what events need to take place...
I think Obito had Hashirama cells in him if I recall, but he was never able to unlock Rinnegan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to answer this question, honestly, but I think at least I can put forward some ideas. From here, please feel free to elaborate, refute, agree or disagree.
My idea is that there is a wide demand for psychological and psychiatric services in the psycho pass universe. It is observed that in the second season&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; they confirmed how much the pharmaceutical industry profits in this universe, with the investment in remedies for the "control of the psycho pass".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when we speak of psychological services, we are not referring to the prescription of remedies, but the use of therapies to deal with problems of psychological order / origin (at least this is where I live, but how a psychologist acts tends to vary widely in several countries). This leads me to reflect a few things: in the psycho pass universe, most people, with a few exceptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; (akane, Makishima, and the enforces possibly),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would tend to live with the fear that their psycho pass may be overcast, so investment in therapy and remedies would tend to be more accepted and even encouraged. From this, it could be concluded that the profession in Japan of psycho pass would be much more valued and, consequently, much better paid than it is today. Now, I do not know how to estimate values, since I have no idea of &#8203;&#8203;current values, but it can be assumed that I would be in a top 10 occupations well payed. HOWEVER, there are some other facts that make me think that, although well paid, the profession might not have so many interested parties. My argument is based on the character of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Saiga Jouji. Formed in psychology, he is supposedly responsible for making people's psycho pass up just by talking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this probably has a very simple explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; people are not prepared to do what he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of stress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; (which is actually the fear of clouding the psycho pass)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;causes people to avoid exposing themselves to stressful situations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; (some, as shown in the anime, until they become lethargic / vegetative)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and because of that they would be ill prepared to cope with stressful situations. Now think: how will you be a therapist or psychologist if you do not know how to handle it? Your job is to listen to your patient about your fears and problems, and lead him to clarify these issues, the best possible way.
Well, to summarize everything I think, my answer would be: yes, it would be a very well paid profession (because it is necessary), but I do not think there would be a lot of people wanting to be a psychologist. More than that, even if the system selects people who have the profile to be psychologists, there would be few people who could actually be. 
By the way, the second season opens an interesting question. In this world, would people tend to bet more on remedies than on psychological treatment? Therapy presupposes that you would have to face certain things it's hard for you to handle yourself, but doing so, at least temporarily,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; the meter of your psycho pass could rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's what I think. Sorry for any mistake in english and if you please indicate that I will try to fix it!&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="15488" Title="Why can't Nagato revert his Rinnegan to Sharingan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;We know that the Rinnegan is the next stage of Sharingan and since Madara can switch from Sharingan to Rinnegan and vice versa, why can't Nagato?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="15594">&lt;p&gt;The reason are most likely similar to Kakashi's Mangekyou Sharingan case. He just simply doesn't realize it. Nagato "awakens" his Rinnegan when his parents are murdered by the mistaken Konoha shinobi. But actually it was Uchiha Madara implanting it to him, not him awakening the Rinnegan. So, while he can use Rinnegan to great extend, he simply doesn't know that it was originated from the Sharingan and that he can revert it back to Sharingan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same as Kakashi. Although he has awakened his Mangekyou when he "killed" Rin, he simply doesn't realize that until years even though he was dubbed as a genius ninja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also it needs to be noted that the ones who knows about the Sharingan can be upgraded into Rinnegan are those who has awakened the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and read the stone tablet in the Uchiha underground hideout using Sharingan, Mangekyou Sharingan and Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan in order. Nagato, being a non-Uchiha and lived far away from Konoha, would have no knowledge of this.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20501">&lt;p&gt;The Rinnegan is extremely rare and is considered as the most powerful among the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Byakugan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Rinnegan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Dojutsu&lt;/a&gt;. Before I get to my answer, it is necessary to look into other cases of dojutsu transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kakashi Hatake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kakashi received the Sharingan at a young age. He had years of experience with it and was considered a genius at the usage of Sharingan. He was even appointed to train Itachi and Sasuke Uchiha with their Sharingan
development. Even with the amount of knowledge and power of the Sharingan, he couldn't revert the Sharingan back to its normal state. That was because of a simple reason: the eye wasn't his. It originally belonged to Obito Uchiha. Since Kakashi wasn't the original owner of the eye, he is unable to revert the eye back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Kakashi Hatake wikia article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because he is not an Uchiha, Kakashi was unable to deactivate this d&#333;jutsu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article tells us that, in order to deactivate the Sharingan, the person needs to be an Uchiha. This can also be related with Danzo Shimura and his arsenal of eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Obito Uchiha&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obito "borrowed" the Rinnegan from Nagato, who originally got them from Madara Uchiha. There were many reasons why Obito implanted only one Rinnegan eye even after having obtained both. However, one of the main reasons was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the guise of Madara and inheriting the former's work, Obito Uchiha claimed that he was entitled to take the Rinnegan from Nagato's body after his death. He then implanted the left Rinnegan into himself and hid the right Rinnegan, &lt;strong&gt;unable to handle the power of both eyes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Obito wasn't the original owner of the eyes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not have complete mastery over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He couldn't handle its overwhelming power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obito, being an Uchiha, lacked control over the Rinnegan. This kind of proves that an Uchiha cannot simply control the Rinnegan if he isn't the original owner. Keep in mind that Obito was trained by Madara himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nagato&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagato received the eyes at a very young age. He did not know that the Rinnegan were transplanted into him, and nor did he know that it evolved from a pair of Sharingan eyes. Nevertheless, he had &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; complete mastery over them because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was an Uzumaki and thus had huge chakra reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eyes were implanted at a very young age, giving him time to perfect his Rinnegan skills by adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/15488/why-cant-nagato-revert-his-rinnegan-to-sharingan/15594#15594"&gt;Sakurai Tomoki's answer&lt;/a&gt; is logical and makes sense. However, if we were to look at similarity between the Rinnegan (evolved from Sharingan) and the Sharingan itself, it seems that answer could be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know from Kakashi's case that he couldn't deactivate the Sharingan because of its origins. We also know that Obito lacked control over the Rinnegan, which implies that he couldn't deactivate and revert it into a Sharingan. Combining these two factors, we can derive an explanation to the original question: Nagato couldn't revert the Rinnegan to Sharingan because he wasn't the eyes' original owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madara displayed certain new and powerful &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Limbo:_Border_Jail" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;techniques&lt;/a&gt; when he received his original eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because Madara was the eyes' original owner, only he could use them to their fullest power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many situations when the power of a borrowed dojutsu is questioned, the full potential of the eyes is always attained by the original owner. So it's logical to conclude that the Rinnegan to Sharingan swap was exclusive to Madara and not to the other two.&lt;/p&gt;

I learned later in the season that they only hate each other because Fushimi joined Homra's most hated clan, Septer 4. Why does he do this? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47227">&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if this can help you, but I can at least give you my opinion from what I read in &lt;em&gt;K -Lost Small World-&lt;/em&gt;. This may be a long explanation so if you go to the bottom, you can see my short-term answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Before Fushimi and Yata, joined HOMRA, it was their own small world; both were really close and happy. Until they joined HOMRA. Yata started to have his own world with other people, that it had lesser and lesser time with Fushimi. Lesser and lesser until Yata wasn't Fushimi's light anymore. One time, the blue king asked for a meeting with them; and one of the representatives was Fushimi which Munakata took notice of. Though Munakata did show that he wants Fushimi to work for him, Fushimi didn't agree just yet, though he did ask if it is possible to change clans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the manga that I read, it was only until chapter 11, but feel free to check if it's been updated. The chapters 12 to 17 are just story strips. It ended with Munakata telling the green king to pull back from attacking Fushimi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a few answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He betrayed HOMRA to get Yata's attention. (Cause of Yata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He went to SCEPTER 4 because Munakata gave him a choice. (Cause of Munakata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He went to SCEPTER 4 because he knows he can be of use to the society and doesn't want to end up like his father. (Cause of Nikki)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He went to SCEPTER 4 because he thinks that he belongs there, and is not fit to be called a Red Clansman. (Cause of Mikoto)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my opinion: 
He did it for him, SCEPTER 4's, HOMRA's, and for other people's own good. If he stayed in HOMRA, nothing will progress for him. Yes, he is a skilled fighter. But if his brain is put to waste I think he can feel himself becoming like Nikki. So that helps himself, SCEPTER 4, and other people. Now, what about HOMRA? What I like about him going to another group was that he could be a bridge that can lead HOMRA and SCEPTER 4 to an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In chapter 36 of the &lt;em&gt;Tsukihime&lt;/em&gt; manga, Akiha doubles over in pain while Shiki is collapsing at the site of the incident eight years ago. The pacing and a remark from Akiha indicating worry for Shiki imply that this is related to Shiki's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zpHm3m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zpHm3m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Akiha still&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why would Akiha have a physical reaction to Shiki's collapse? I do not recall seeing any indication of the two being linked physically or mentally in the way Shiki and SHIKI are. (Shiki eventually sees murders from SHIKI's eyes. We don't see Akiha undergo the same experiences as Shiki in this maner.) Alternatively, am I misunderstanding what happens here?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="37561">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do not recall seeing any indication of the two being linked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually they are. In the visual novel, in Akiha's Route, what really happened when Shiki collpased is revealed. SHIKI inverted and attacked Akiha but Shiki protected her and died; however, Akiha gave up some of her life force to save Shiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She was outside playing with Shiki, her adopted brother, and her real brother, also named SHIKI. But the Tohno blood was much stronger in her real brother and he inverted to his non-human form. In this uncontrollable state, he lost control of himself and attempted to attack Akiha. Shiki jumped in the way to protect her and took the full force of the attack. Shiki died protecting Akiha, but Akiha used powers granted to her by her non-human blood to give him half of her life, allowing him to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akiha's pained expression is most likely from the strain of maintaining Shiki's 
life alongside resisting the Inversion Impulse of the Tohno Demon Blood inside her, which she requires Kohaku's help for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Akiha often struggles to maintain control over her Tohno blood and resisting her Inversion Impulse, which she has difficulty with due to her also maintaining Shiki's life, to the point she also had to drink Kohaku&#8217;s blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her route however, it becomes too much as she succumbs to her Inversion Impulse in the end. In the True End of her route:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; [Shiki] decides to kill himself instead (so that she will regain the life energy she gave Shiki when he died eight years ago, and then will be restored to her full strength so she can more easily resist her Tohno blood impulses and restore her mind).&lt;/p&gt;

However in SAO we see Agil and Lisbeth run their own stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was SAO's community-driven nature (i.e. players assume the roles as shopkeepers) a part of the original specification, or did this only occur because Kayaba trapped everyone?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;hr&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1: There is one recent MMORPG I am aware of that has a player controlled economy where players have to find their own jobs within the game (i.e. farmer, blacksmith, trainer) but I can't remember the name and it is also the only MMORPG I am aware of that does this.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28535">&lt;p&gt;While MMORPGs do usually have shop NPCs, it is important to note that they usually don't sell the best gear. (Or even good gear)&lt;br&gt;
The best gear is either from bosses, random drops, or, from crafting. It seems that in SAO, good gear was made via crafting, as we see when Kirito asks Liz to make him a sword, and they go hunting for materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems like it was intended to be community driven, as you could raise skills, and craft, and as it is fairly obvious that not everybody wants to have a high blacksmith skill, as you could always buy it with money you get otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you say Igneel, but I think you mean Agil.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 19, Natsu, Gray, Happy and Lucie should have been punished because they &quot;stole&quot; an S-Rank quest. However, the master wasn't there, so they wanted to take another quest. When they read the quest content, it swapped their bodies/minds. The master then entered and tried to help them, and the episode ends.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Episode 20 starts in a forest where Natsu and Happy are fishing, so the &quot;ending&quot; of Episode 19 is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did I watch a wrong &quot;source&quot; or is this part really missing?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="2755">&lt;p&gt;Episode 19 (filler episode) and episode 20 (omake episode) are non-canonical from a continuity perspective. In the manga, when they return to Magnolia, Erza reminds them about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; punishment (just like in the anime), but then they see their guild building destroyed. This begins the next Phantom Lord arc, and thus the punishment matter gets dropped naturally. Since the punishment was never shown in canon, they probably decided to skip it in the anime too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In any case, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; punishment is most likely something silly, such as the one in episode 75 later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="12857">&lt;p&gt;We never actually find out what "THAT" is. All we learn is that it is horrifying enough to make Natsu scream in terror and Gray cry/breakdown at the thought of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion is that knowing Makarov and how much he loves his "children" I doubt that it's something painful; rather my guess is that it's probably something intensely humiliating.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Is Rin's Eclipse (H-)scene (Beginners) in Fate/hollow ataraxia canon?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to know if it follows Rin's true ending. Just to make it clear, I'm not asking if FHA follows UBW, I'm asking if that H-scene follows UBW True End (or maybe Good End).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36578">&lt;p&gt;Spoilers regarding the H-scenes ahead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take it it appears too good to be true for you. 
Now, is it canon? Nasu did confirm it as such. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to state my opinion I'd say as a whole Rin's scene does seem very reasonable just like the other eclipse scenes. If something, I'd add that the competition part (they fight to win over who pleasures the other more; Shirou becoming even a bit cruel and unlike himself whe he tells her at the beginning to touch herself while he watches), Rin using her magic to make her weight disappear even when orgasming and the use of apphrodisiacs may be more like fanservice, but then again it is an eroge and since the very beginning Nasu made Shirou unable to give mana but through sex because he has no magical knowledge. You can't get more porn vibes than that.
Think that Rin becoming more feminine, enjoying herself with Shirou and starting to accept her feelings a bit more is what makes sense after the UBW route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the first one to reply this question and now there are 5 other answers (there are 6 counting mine as of now, from &#1082;&#1103;&#945;z&#1108;&#1103;, Memor, Lord, Echomateria, Dumpster Player and myself). I don't agree with some statements from  &#1082;&#1103;&#945;z&#1108;&#1103; as I showed in my comments to his answer. After reading all the answers I have more reasons to believe it does happen after UBW. Some of the arguments given in other answers are that the eclipse scenes are canon as I had said in my original post, that they don't belong to Fate Hollow's actual game but are instead set up to be a direct continuation of some of the original game endings...
And it's true. They don't belong to the storyline followed by Fate Hollow and it's also true they've been composed to follow Fate Stay Night endings. It does make sense for them to be a continuation as their canonicity has been established by the game authors. Pretty much everyone defend this point of view (Echomateria, Memor, Lord and myself outright defend this point of view).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About Hollow's true ending, which happens outside the time loop, Memor and Dumpster didn't touch this topic as it wasn't asked by the OP. I would completely agree with Echomateria and Lord's answer in that regard though a. As echomateria said in his answer it would be an alternate reality, just like each route is an alternate reality from each other. So basically it would be another route made by Nasu. According to the creators an scenario also exists where it is actually the sequel to Stay Night. This was actually treated in more detail by Lord in his answer.
When Takeuchi was asked whether Hollow is the continution of all 3 routes his conclusion was that the reader should interpret it however he wants, so either way.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36646">&lt;p&gt;You misunderstand what &lt;em&gt;Fate/hollow ataraxia&lt;/em&gt; actually is. It is not a direct continuation of &lt;em&gt;Fate/stay night.&lt;/em&gt; It encompasses the endings of all of the routes, while at the same time not being any of them. Despite all that has happened in &lt;em&gt;Fate/stay night&lt;/em&gt;, the story starts from a situation where everyone, plus extra characters and minus a certain character, is present with nobody thinks thinking unusual, except Shirou (the plot elaborates on why this is the case).
It's mentioned that &lt;em&gt;Fate/hollow ataraxia&lt;/em&gt; not appear to follow a particular route from &lt;em&gt;Fate/stay night&lt;/em&gt;, and that it was written in a non-serious manner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an interview with Takeuchi and Nasu in &lt;em&gt;Toradayo&lt;/em&gt; 61, Jan 2006, mentions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: So, should it be best to think that Fate/hollow ataraxia isn&#8217;t a continuation of the Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heavens Feel arcs of the last game?&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Takeuchi: Yes. It's not really what happens after each route, but more of a "counter" to "Fate/stay night" itself&#8230; is what feels more comfortable right now, I think. While there is a setting about this happening after this route, personally, I don&#8217;t think it's that important. Basically, I think the player should interpret it however he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Nasu: I personally wrote "Reunion", the introductory portion of Fate/hollow ataraxia with the intention of it being the ending of a certain route in Fate/stay night and the ending of "hollow ataraxia".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that "it's best if you don't think too much about it," (&lt;em&gt;Fate/complete material III: World material&lt;/em&gt; - FAQ with Nasu: Miscellaneous, p.136) when questioned about its place in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;em&gt;Fate/stay night&lt;/em&gt; routes and 
&lt;em&gt;Fate/hollow ataraxia&lt;/em&gt; happen in alternative universes of sorts. That's how Nasu's multiverse works &#8211; it's made up of several alternative sub-universes, so even mutually exclusive routes are all "true" or canon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you make an attempt to connect the dots, there is a route that fits (as noted in the above interview) with the storyline of the plot of &lt;em&gt;Fate/hollow ataraxia&lt;/em&gt; and meets all the requirements to completely make this possible, but that's for another topic.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37131">&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna express my opinion regarding the OP question. I will explain where I got got my info and how I came upon my conclusion.
My opinion based on Nasu and Takeuchi's words is that it can be considered a sequel to the original game if the reader wants it and therefore so would the eclipse scenes. I will also add a theory at the end of my post and it will be based on the way the eclipse scenes are set, my experience reading 100% of the Visual Novel and Nasu's answer to the first question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Fate/hollow_ataraxia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Fate/hollow_ataraxia&lt;/a&gt; (at the end of the page you can see Nasu and Takeuchi expressing their opinion regarding Fate Hollow). I will use quotes of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fate Hollow Ataraxia was sold back in the day as a sequel and even the true ending, now outside the loop, is called "sequel".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I side with Sanji's opinion in this regard. After reading the whole interview there's no question they don't deny it. The first question the interviwer makes is whether hollow is the after story or not. Nasu's answer was: "We mentioned it a little bit earlier, but &#8220;hollow&#8221; is set in Fuyuki city half a year after Fate/stay night. But despite that, the story&#8217;s starting from a situation where everyone, + some extra people and minus a certain character, is present and nobody thinks that&#8217;s unusual."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it's normal he'd say that, after all he's describing the time-loop. But even so he finishes saying "but we believe it should be left up to the user&#8217;s imagination"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question is "So, should it be best to think that Fate/hollow ataraxia isn&#8217;t a continuation of the Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heavens Feel arcs of the last game?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeuchi's answer is quite vague:"It&#8217;s not really what happens after each route, but more of a &#8220;counter&#8221; to &#8220;Fate/stay night&#8221; itself&#8230;..is what feels more comfortable right now... Basically, I think the player should interpret it however he wants."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying "is what feels confortable right now isn't a compelling argument". In the end he says the reader decides, just like Nasu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third question is yet again a similar version of the others: "Is it safe to assume that Hollow's "Sequel" follows none of the three routes&#8217; endings in Fate/stay night? (meaning a parallel universe with different possibilities)" The answer Nasu gives: "It&#8217;s best if you don&#8217;t think too much about it".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I see is that both of them arrive at the same conclusion, the reader decides, and want to leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the characters get out of the loophole, if you like the ending your headcanon becomes canon because the authors say so. So the true ending of Fate Hollow would become the sequel to Fate Stay Night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't like it, then don't worry. The original story remains untouched and Ataraxia is either a fourth route or the ending to one of the original routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem vague, but if both of them literally tell the reader to interpret it however he wants it's impossible to have a clear asnwer. They make canon both interpretations in a very straightforward manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the interpretation it was written in a non-serious manner given by &#1082;&#1103;&#945;z&#1108;&#1103;
It is based on the answer "It&#8217;s best if you don&#8217;t think too much about it"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how I look at it, the only thing I see is the interviewer wanting a clear answer. It is the third time a very similar question is asked and this time Nasu makes it stop saying "dont think too much about it", which makes sense given his previous replies. Nasu knows they gave 2 vague replies the previous times "it will be up to the user" and he just sticks to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why I'm sure it's this way is that it would have been very easy to just say yes to the last question, saying it is another universe like he does with many of his works (Unlimited Blade Works, Prisma Illya, Fate Extra...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion him not saying that would mean we are in the same universe and the reader can consider it a sequel to FSN if he wants to as they say. I'd also say Nasu actually gives a lot of credit to this work, which is btw is 2/3 of the original visual novel's size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I do believe, based on the way the eclipse scenes are set and my experience reading 100% of the Visual Novel and Nasu's words that there is better way to think Rin's eclipse scene happens after UBW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you finished reading the Visual Novel you must have realized the eclipse scenes take place outside the proper game. They're set up exactly to continue each route. In Rin's case, Shirou describes their previous time making love and past experiences in UBW. Rider would be Heaven's Feel, so would Sakura...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasu said " We mentioned it a little bit earlier, but &#8220;hollow&#8221; is set in Fuyuki city half a year after Fate/stay night. But despite that, the story&#8217;s starting from a situation where everyone, + some extra people and minus a certain character, is present and nobody thinks that&#8217;s unusual. While Shirou, the protagonist thinks this is weird, he can&#8217;t figure out what exactly is unusual. He&#8217;s in that kind of unstable situation, but he&#8217;s genuinely enjoying the &#8220;festivities&#8221; feeling that it&#8217;s great how everyone&#8217;s around".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these scenes don't belong to that description and they're clearly staged after each route. They don't belong to the actual plot of the game. Nasu confirmed them as canon so I don't have any reason to believe they don't really happen after each route. In my opinion they're like a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not something very relevant but Memor said in a thread things like the fact that it is confirmed Rider-Shirou because of the love confession in her eclipse scene, not a very far-fetched comment considering Nasu said those scenes are canon.I would agree with him. So yes, in my opinion Rin's scene is canon and would take place after UBW. Or at the very least the authors tell you can interpret it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37206">&lt;p&gt;It's not stated to be, but you can pretend it is a continuation of the UBW True End. It's shown during the scene where Rin got trapped in the Second Magic Chest that in at least one alternative universe where Rin and Shirou are lovers, Rin actually dropped her tsun completely and is head over heels in love with Shirou to the point where she sounds like one of those sickening sweet lovebirds.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37608">&lt;p&gt;To answer your question let's start with the question &#191;What's Fate Hollow Ataraxia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fate Hollow is an alternate reality, just like each route is an alternate reality of each other. You can basically consider it the fourth route to the original game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why it is called a sequel by many people are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the authors say an scenario exists where it is actually a direct continuation. If they say so there must be some truth behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna make an example to make it more clear:
The thing is that Rin develops a new kind of magic. This was explained a little at the end of FSN.
This magic allows travel between dimensions and therefore routes. The example would be a hand that picks 2 girls and throws them to a new dimension/route. One girl is Sakura, who is picked from after the war HF. The other is Rin, from after the war UBW.
So, do we have different route? Yes, but Sakura comes from Heaven's Feel ending so her actions in Ataraxia reflect what she would do in her own route under certain circumstances. The same for Rin.
This second point is a reason to consider it kinda a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eclipse/hentai scenes are quite different though from the actual game. They aren't part of Fate Hollow Ataraxia. They really are a fully-fledged continuations of the original game endings as they are written to literally continue them. They are something like a plus and are clearly written to continue FSN endings.
Nasu made a confirmation of them being canon. If we add the fact that they aren't part of the actual Ataraxia game and that they follow endings from the original game it would make zero sense to not consider them their continuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eclipse scene begginers that you ask about references Rin and Shirou's sexual activities in UBW between other stuff. What Nasu is telling us is that their sex is going well, unlike in the original game. Nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakura's scene happens after Heaven's Feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saber's scene golden bathtub most likely happens after UBW good ending. It can't be the fate route as the first time Shirou and Saber have sex alone is the night before she dies, where he was so nervous he didn't even know what to do. There aren't more times to have sex as she dies afterwards.
Saber in Fate Hollow comes from UBW good ending. The way the H-scene occurs makes it seem they're not in a formal relationship (having sex sometimes is what their relationship seems to be about) and that Saber is fine and isn't gonna die. 
It shouldn't come as a surprise though. In UBW Good ending Nasu hints strongly Shirou is gonna have sex with Saber.
Some hints are that Shirou's magical energy (semen) is needed to maintain saber as  Rin's energy isn't enough, Saber says in the  VN she's staying for him, Rin tells saber not to flirt with him and to stop looking at each other for so long. Basically one of the typical harem endings in a porn game.
We don't know if Rin and Saber have sex in Unlimited good ending as nothing is ever hinted/mentioned in either the eclipse scenes or the game itself that may point out they ever have a sexual relationship over there. Also, Rin provides magic to Saber thanks to her link and no sex is needed as she's an experienced magi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rider scene happens after HF. 
Basically it is revealed that Rider falls in love with Shirou and likes meeting him to have sex with him. In her eclipse scene she confesses she loves him. Rider says she thinks about him when she's alone but she feels bad about Sakura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it something new? Not really, we just got a confirmation of what we already knew. Remember when Rider said she is sucking regularly someone's blood and that she can't let Sakura Know? That is mentioned somewhere at the end of Heaven's Feel in the original game. She thought that after 2 years living together with Shirou and Sakura. They're the only ones living together in the Emiya house (Rin lives in London). So it has to be Shirou as she thinks Sakura must not know. And how does Rider suck blood? She just bites you unless you're Shirou. In Heaven's Feel Route She finds Shirou so juicy she has sex with him as well. The rest of the people just got the bite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My  final conclusion: I've based my answer on a few facts. We know that the eclipse/hentai scenes aren't part of Fate Hollow Ataraxia's actual game. We know that they were confirmed as canon by the authors. We also know that they are written to continue certain endings from the original game. 
Final conclusion: To me it would make zero sense for them not to be their direct continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37614">&lt;p&gt;I believe it is because &lt;em&gt;Fate/Hollow Ataraxia&lt;/em&gt; is in a way very similar to another Type-Moon game and that's &lt;em&gt;Kagetsu Tohya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Fate/Hollow Ataraxia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kagetsu Tohya&lt;/em&gt; is the "sequal" game to a Type-Moon game, &lt;em&gt;Tsukihime&lt;/em&gt;, which has 5 Routes with about 2 proper endings (as opposed to dead end/game over endings) for each one. like &lt;em&gt;Fate/Hollow Ataraxia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kagetsu Tohya&lt;/em&gt; is set in a looped world where after the story progresses so much time (in &lt;em&gt;Kagetsu Tohya&lt;/em&gt; it's 1 day) or Tohno Shiki is killed everything restarts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also both features bonus scenes which do not occur in the space of the main game. in &lt;em&gt;Kagetsu Tohya&lt;/em&gt; these are called &lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Kagetsu_Tohya#Ten_Nights_of_Dream" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ten Nights of Dream&lt;/a&gt;, quoting the link these are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first seven of these stories were written by Kinoko Nasu like the rest of Kagetsu Tohya, while the last three are contribution works by others, essentially fanfiction. It is unknown if any of these stories are to be considered canon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ciel teaches the rest of the cast in her role as Ciel-sensei from Tsukihime. The story is mainly a comedy story, reflecting on parts of the series in the form of questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Story for the Evening
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Akiha solves a mystery in her boarding school. This story is a sequel to her true ending in Tsukihime.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The Tohno Family Con Game
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nearly the whole cast plays an elaborate game of tag for Kohaku's sake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dawn (or Daybreak)
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The continued story of the girl that gets devoured in the park by Nrvnqsr Chaos in Tsukihime. Takes place after Arcueid's Good Ending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see a number of these stories follow particular endings, for instnace &lt;em&gt;A Story for the Evening&lt;/em&gt; follows Akiha's True end because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; at the end Akiha recives a letter from Ciel saying that Shiki didn't die when he killed himself in Akiha's True End and saved him. Akiha is annoyed by this because it was Ceil who saved Shiki and not her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My belief that &lt;em&gt;Beginners&lt;/em&gt; (the name of the scene as indicated &lt;a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Fate/hollow_ataraxia#Eclipse" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is after the Unlimited Blade Works Route is becaue the same page i linked to says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shirou is stranded at Rin's home during a rainy day. Both alone in an empty house they decide to remedy their previous sexual failures and make progress in their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if i recall what i read about the H Scene in the original &lt;em&gt;Fate/Stay Night&lt;/em&gt; at the end Rin complained that Shirou wasn't gentle and they won't do it again. to me the above quote implies they already have a relationship and what happened in the H Scene in Unlimited Blade Works occured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However &lt;strong&gt;this does not mean that &lt;em&gt;Fate/Hollow Ataraxia&lt;/em&gt; is a sequal to &lt;em&gt;Fate/Stay Night's&lt;/em&gt; Unlimited Blade Works Route&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are no other characters that do this. Why does he include random English words in his sentences (it seems that the English words may even be voiced by someone else, as they sound incredibly out of place with the Japanese dialogue)?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="36521">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Kabaneri&lt;/em&gt; universe, the steam technology that powers all their steampunk stuff was &lt;a href="http://kabaneri.com/sp/keyword/03.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;initially developed outside Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The particular system that drives the railforts is named the &lt;a href="http://kabaneri.com/sp/keyword/01.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;"McRucky engine"&lt;/a&gt;, and is of British design. The first major outbreak of kabane was &lt;a href="http://kabaneri.com/sp/keyword/" rel="nofollow"&gt;reportedly somewhere in eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems plausible that most steamsmiths would be from Europe (perhaps Britain in particular) given that that's where steam technology originated. Suzuki could well be a steamsmith from Europe who ended up in Japan, perhaps fleeing the kabane (Japan, being an island on the periphery of Afro-Eurasia, is about as far as you can get from eastern Europe without hopping over to the Americas). In this case, it would be unsurprising that his speech is 1.) heavily accented; and 2.) has a heavy admixture of English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Don't be fooled by his Japanese-seeming name - in the real world around the time of the Industrial Revolution, it was common for Westerners in Japan to take Japanese names. See, for example, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lafcadio Hearn&lt;/a&gt;, who was known in Japan as "Koizumi Yakumo".)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that &lt;a href="http://kabaneri.com/mediamix/" rel="nofollow"&gt;the manga and/or light novels&lt;/a&gt; will have more detail about this, but I have not read any of them. Likewise, if they ever release one of those production-notes compilations, that'd be a good thing to have a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;it seems that the English words may even be voiced by someone else, as they sound incredibly out of place with the Japanese dialogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzuki's voice actor, Maxwell Powers, is fluent in both languages. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn7oWq3ADi2YjdYBUm4tfiQ/videos?shelf_id=0&amp;amp;view=0&amp;amp;sort=dd" rel="nofollow"&gt;His YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; has some examples of his non-anime voice work. According to &lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%83%91%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA" rel="nofollow"&gt;his Japanese Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, he grew up in the US, so he's clearly a native speaker of English, and his mother is Japanese and he went to college in Japan, so it's no surprise that his Japanese is pretty good too. It's pretty clear to me that he voices all of Suzuki's lines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, he apparently is emceeing the live event &lt;a href="http://kabaneri.com/event/utage/" rel="nofollow"&gt;"Koutetsujou no Utage"&lt;/a&gt; which is happening as I type.)&lt;/p&gt;

I've only watched a few minutes into it (probably just an opening), and the few details that I remember are:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A spaceship, not too big, probably a single-pilot fighter, with a&#10;streamlined design and a small forward-swept winglet protruding from its&#10;underside (like a hook of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://texascreek.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/trencher.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;trencher machine&lt;/a&gt;); the ship&#10;probably had a greenish tint (though it could be a VHS color&#10;artifact);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The pilot was a long-haired girl; her design was probably typical for that era (at least, I can't remember anything particular about her, except for the serious face expression); she was beautiful, that's for sure;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There also was another ship (no winglet) with a female pilot, but I'm not completely sure about that;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't remember anything important happening during those minutes&#10;(no dogfights etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't remember anything &quot;European&quot; or &quot;Victorian&quot; in the design of&#10;ships and pilots (as opposed to popular space operas of the 80s); even if there was any, it was subtle;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't remember any other characters, ships, or locations from those few&#10;minutes;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Overall, it seems like it was a serious title, not a&#10;comedy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am definitely not an expert in the retro-space-opera department, so it could easily be something totally mainstream. Since it was on a bootleg VHS, it could be an OVA, a full-length movie, or a TV episode.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;UPD. The winglet was small, compared to the craft dimensions (see the trencher machine proportions). Overall, the craft design was rather streamlined. It didn't look like a &quot;many pieces held together&quot; thing (in terms of the game FTL: more of the Stealth cruiser than Engi or Lanius one).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20798">&lt;p&gt;A bit of stab in the dark, but I think you might be referring to something by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiji_Matsumoto" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Leiji Matsumoto&lt;/a&gt;. Beautiful long-haired women are a dime a dozen in his works, and there are at least few ship designs with something like a winglet on the underside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spacewolf fighter from the various Captain Harlock TV shows and movies usually has a winglet on the underside. The version on the left below, from Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX, is noticeably swept forward. The enemy Mazone fighters, always piloted by women with long hair, also can have something like a underside winglet, like the example below on the right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit of a stretch, but but if you didn't realize how big it is, The Queen Emeraldas, kinda sorta fits your description. It has a long "streamlined" shape and the gondola can sorta look like a forward swept winglet depending on how it gets drawn. Despite its size I believe it's usually shown a being piloted by one long-haired woman.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice) my current interpretation of the X on someone's face is that the protagonist does not wish to acknowledge or socialize with this person.

  &lt;h2&gt;Spoiler Warning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the summary of this answer is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "X" mark can be symbolized as "Not My Friend" or "No interest to interact with them". When Ishida feels pissed off because of an act or the attitude of someone/something, the "X" mark would be put on their faces. And when would the "X" mark be taken down? When Ishida thinks like "I like him/her, such a nice person" about someone or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Ueno is so hypocritical, that make Ishida so pissed and happy at the same time. The X mark on Ueno's face was first marked in volume 3, and it came off in Volume 7 (the last volume), when Ishida tried to change himself. In volume 7, all the 'X' marks that everyone had in Ishida's perspective have already come off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I could figure, the most accepted answer for this kind of question is one where you can find in the manga version.  Although I have not watched the anime in full, the anime version seems lacking in explanation. And of course I have finished the manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What is the significance of the X on people's faces from Ishida's perspective?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The X's first appeared in Volume 1, Chapter 5, page 2-6.
Here are some of the pages (read from right to left)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page 2-3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has an&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; anxiety disorder being with other people.
 He feels pissed off because of his own negative thought about the others. Look at the yellow marker, he hates everything, even the friend of friends that he hated. The "X" mark can be symbolized as "Not My Friend" or "No interest to interact with them". So that's the reason why the entire class have "X" mark on their faces. For Nagatsuka why he got "X" mark from the first, there is something that Ishida hates about him. For the other people like Sahara that doesn't have "X" mark when they met on the train, because Ishida has no reason to hate Sahara for some reason (exclude his classmate nor neighborhood that he hate). He will put the "X" mark down when someone wants to acknowledge him more and he trusted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Why does Ueno get the X on and off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's explained in Volume 3, Chapter 18, Page 12-17 (read from right to left).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ishida said that he doesn't care about his ex-friend (aka all his  elementary school friends) in pages 12-13, but when he met Ueno for the first time since junior high school, he did care. At first, Ueno's face didn't have the "X" mark but in chapter 21, pages 9-10, Ueno did something terrible to Shouko, and that made Ishida really pissed of with Ueno's attitude. So that's why Ueno got the 'X' mark on pages 15-16. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="13472" Title="Was Kodomo no Jikan controversial in Japan?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently read the Kodomo no Jikan manga. Then I read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodomo_no_Jikan#Controversy&quot;&gt;the massive controversy when Seven Seas tried to release the series in the US&lt;/a&gt;, explained in excruciating detail by Seven Seas's Jason DeAngelis &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gomanga.com/blog/01.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and summarized &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/industry-comments/2007-05-29/jason-deangelis-nymphet&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I also read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-06-07/nymphet-creator-u.s-publisher-blog-on-cancellation&quot;&gt;Kaworu Watashiya's response, showing that she absolutely did not one bit understand why the series was so controversial over here&lt;/a&gt;, and that machine translation still has a long way to go, since Watashiya got all her information from reading American forums passed through Google Translate. (I was particularly puzzled by her comments, made with an authoritative tone, that &quot;An adult, even a parent, who takes a bath with a child would be arrested&quot; in the United States.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://mrcaxton.livejournal.com/26421.html&quot;&gt;This source&lt;/a&gt; also claims the series is only regarded as &quot;mildly risqu&amp;eacute;&quot; in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm just too American, but Kojikan seemed like it would be at least somewhat controversial in almost any country. Rin is only in third grade when the series starts, and the later chapters deal with issues like sex ed, masturbation, menstruation, and sexual assault in a fairly realistic way. &lt;strong&gt;Was there any public controversy around the series in Japan? Did it raise any eyebrows at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd appreciate sources. Obviously, if the answer is &quot;no&quot;, there is no such evidence, so my threshold for &quot;no controversy&quot; is &quot;nothing visible in a major media outlet&quot;. If the United Moral Guardians of Podunksville, Hokkaido published a statement condemning Kojikan, I do not expect anyone to find it. (Though good job if you do.) I'm asking for evidence of a reasonably high-profile controversy, around the same scale as the one surrounding the US release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="13478">&lt;p&gt;At least for anime version, there are some discussion and some TV station cancelled the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodomo_no_Jikan#Anime"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[...] two television stations &#8212; TV Saitama and Mie TV &#8212; removed it from their broadcast schedules. In an official press release, TV Saitama stated that their decision was heavily influenced by the then-recent capture of Takayuki Hosoda, a notorious Japanese child  pornographer who was revealed to be an elementary school vice principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't read &lt;em&gt;Kodomo no Jikan&lt;/em&gt; yet. In my understanding, Kodomo no Jikan contains two taboos. One is sexual interest from child, and the other one is love relationship between teacher and student.
First one is also controversial in Japan.
But for second one, it doesn't get any attention in Japan (if it's in fiction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other example of teacher-student taboo in US is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardcaptor_Sakura"&gt;Cardcaptor Sakura&lt;/a&gt;.
This anime was aired by NHK (BBC or PBS equivalent in Japan). It's not controversial in Japan.
But the NA version was heavy edited.
All love relationship between teacher and student was removed with same-sex love relationship.
(e.g. father and mother of protagonist met each other when the mother entered university that the father worked as professor.)&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;If someone eats a devil fruit, they can get some power depending on the fruit that they eat.&#10;The side effect for eating this fruit is that the user cannot swim.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How about the artificial devil fruits that are made by Dr. Vegapunk? Is it the case that people that eat artificial devil fruits also can't swim and are weakened by the sea?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="31339">&lt;p&gt;Yes they cannot swim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fruit grants the general weaknesses a natural Devil Fruit would, as shown when Momonosuke could not swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find it on the Wikia: &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Artificial_Devil_Fruit" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Artificial_Devil_Fruit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="31341">&lt;p&gt;Yes, artificial devil fruit users suffer from the same weakness has the "natural" devil fruit counterparts: they cannot swim. This was shown in Chapter 795, page 6:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZitMg.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZitMg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add something in response to Namikaze Sheena's comment. First of all, to be precise, it is not that devil fruit users cannot swim, but rather they become &lt;strong&gt;powerless&lt;/strong&gt;  when their body is submerged in water. As a consequence, they cannot swim or even move at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if Vegapunk were to feed a devil fruit to a boat, I think (this is pure speculation) it would not sink: the boat floats because wood is lighter than water, which is a physical property that it would keep even on top of water. It would lose strength, but maybe not completely as we have previously seen Luffy retain control of his body if only a fraction of it is submerged (e.g. on their way to fishman island, Chapter 605, page 11). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the above picture, we can somewhat see Brook and Momosuke (in dragon's form) drowning. Here is a picture of Momosuke is his Zoan form:&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="22232" Title="What're the names of the Thunder and Poison Dragons?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Fairy Tail, all the Dragons have names, like the Fire Dragon, Igneel. But I don't remember anyone mentioning the names of the Thunder Dragon or the Poison Dragon in the anime. Does someone know what their names are?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="22233">&lt;p&gt;Laxus and Cobra are &lt;a href="http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Slayer#Second_Generation" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second generation Dragon Slayers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so they weren't taught Dragon Slayer Magic by a Dragon. Hence, Thunder and Poison Dragons are never mentioned (moreover, they possibly do not exist at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those from the second generation of Dragon Slayers have had Dragon Lacrima implanted into their bodies, granting them the ability to use Dragon Slayer Magic. Because they were not taught their abilities by a Dragon, they are considered artificial Dragon Slayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36280">&lt;p&gt;The dragon lacrima is only able to be extracted out of the dragons when they are dead, so technically, there was a thunder dragon and a poison dragon, but they were most probably on the verge of dying, or already dead, so the lacrima could be extracted and placed in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="20957" Title="How do you train in a jutsu that kills you if used?" Body="&lt;p&gt;For example, Guy Sensei and Rock Lee can use the Eight Gates technique. If the last gate is opened, you die.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of emphasis in the series that shows that one must train very hard to perfect a jutsu, technique, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But how do you train and perfect something that you can only do once... and then just die?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20970">&lt;p&gt;It's like jumping off a building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can jump from the first, second or third floor and survive. The method to reach all the floors remains the same &lt;em&gt;(Climbing by stairs... or you may call this training.)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a certain number of floors, you will come to a realization that after you jump through this floor (let's just say the 20th -- &lt;em&gt;you need not practice climbing 20 floors for this -- the experience of climbing one floor is just fine)&lt;/em&gt;, you will &lt;em&gt;become extinct&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need the experience nor practice to reach the 20th floor but you will surely &lt;em&gt;become extinct&lt;/em&gt; if you jump from there.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="15133" Title="Was Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi ever released in English?" Body="&lt;p&gt;When I was five or six years old, sometime around 1994, I pestered my mother to buy me a VHS tape about three little ghosts from the stand next to the checkout at the grocery store. I watched that video over and over again, then forgot about it until recently, when I remembered it, recalled how much the art style looked like early Pokemon, and suddenly realized that that was probably the first anime I ever saw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In preparation to write an id request, I did some searching, and I now think the show I saw was probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ghosts,_There,_Here,_and_Where&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi&lt;/a&gt;. The timeframe is right, the plot sounds similar, and the picture seems familiar. The character names listed for the Spanish and Polish dubs on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1042&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Anime News Network&lt;/a&gt; sound familiar and both Anime News Network and &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/anime/310/Chiisana_Obake_Acchi_Kocchi_Socchi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My Anime List&lt;/a&gt; give the show the English title &lt;em&gt;Three Little Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. Anime News Network even lists English language script staff. But there's nothing under &quot;English cast&quot; or &quot;English companies&quot;, and I can't find any hard evidence that it was actually released in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi ever released in the US, and if so, when and by whom?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20340">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+made+Saban+rich,+selling+falafels+makes+him+secure.-a012251839" rel="nofollow"&gt;article that senshin found&lt;/a&gt; indicates that Saban Entertainment, the infamous anime mutilator and "creator" of Power Rangers, co-produced Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi, so it seems incomprehensible that they wouldn't have produced an English dub. I also found an &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9cts_P1H0I" rel="nofollow"&gt;English-dubbed video&lt;/a&gt; of Three Little Ghosts which I am quite sure is the show I saw. The &lt;a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1042" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anime News Network page&lt;/a&gt; gives the three ghosts' English names as Sally, Bumper, and Cutter, which is exactly what I remember their names being in the show I saw. The ANN page doesn't list any English voice actors, but &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhichOneWasThatVoice" rel="nofollow"&gt;this TV Tropes page&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Saban and other dubbing studios around this time frequently didn't credit the voice actors, so it's possible that the compilers of the ANN page couldn't find any information on the English voice actors and decided to leave it blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I'm quite satisfied that Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi was released in the US and that it was the show I saw. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo Ghoul:Re 2, episode 2, Kichimura tears the one-eyed owl kakuja apart easily, when she was supposed to be the strongest Ghoul until that point in the anime series. Why was it so easy for Kichimura to tear the one-eyed owl kakuja apart?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50133">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was it so easy for Kichimura to tear the one-eyed owl kakuja apart?&lt;/strong&gt; Because Kichimura is not as weak as he makes it seem to be. He is one of the &lt;a href="http://tokyoghoul.wikia.com/wiki/Half-human" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;half-humans&lt;/a&gt; raised in the Sunlit Garden, together with Arima. As stated &lt;a href="http://tokyoghoul.wikia.com/wiki/Half-human" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Half-humans have highly developed physical capabilities, and I think a good example for this difference from normal humans are Kishou Arima's and Squad Zero's abilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from those enhance abilities, Kichimura also became an artificial one-eyed ghoul, possessing Rize's kagune like Kaneki. While not directly stated in the manga, it is heavily hinted that &lt;em&gt;one-eyed ghouls are much more powerful than normal ones&lt;/em&gt;. Rize and her kagune's strength is also recognized and this is seen by the fact that she was the one used by Kichimura to become &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;his 'dragon' after Kaneki, who was temporarily his 'dragon', was rescued during the Dragon War arc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this and the fact that Kishou Arima is able to hold his own fighting Eto before, it would, therefore, not be impossible for Kichimura to do the same, &lt;em&gt;with the same capabilities as Arima and further enhanced by Rize's kagune&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;em&gt;Kichimura has the element of surprise, and Eto was not expecting his power&lt;/em&gt;. If she knew, she might have been more careful but as seen in that episode, she just attacked head-on and you can clearly see the look of surprise in her face as her kakuja is torn.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;There are songs from OSTs, or even full albums by bands or singers in the anime, that I have never heard in the anime. Some music albums for which this is true:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vgmdb.net/album/22436&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion: S&#178; Works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Neon_Genesis_Evangelion#Neon_Genesis_Evangelion:_S.C2.B2_Works&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;many unused songs and alternate mixes or arrangements of existing songs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vgmdb.net/album/26163&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Portrait de Petit Cossette Original Soundtrack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; the song &lt;em&gt;my love, so sweet&lt;/em&gt; is never used in the OVA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vgmdb.net/album/20060&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the Beats!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by GirlDeMo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vgmdb.net/album/39531&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;God only knows -Secrets of the Goddess-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; the full version that is &lt;strong&gt;11 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; longer than the one used in the OP of &lt;em&gt;The World God Only Knows: Goddesses&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why do they do this? For fan service? To make us feel like the bands or singers are real artists? Or to get more profits from CD sales? In which case, couldn't they have just picked the cheaper alternative of selecting some existing songs that are good fits for the anime?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6166">&lt;p&gt;The Opening and Ending tracks are normally shorter for anime, as the songs were usually originals developed before the anime and the artist was paid for a portion of it to be used in the anime, not to mention that the songs also need to fit in broadcast time. On the other hand, there are also Opening and Ending tracks which were purposely made for the anime (or the other way around like the case of &lt;em&gt;Black Rock Shooter&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some songs are even from full albums by the bands or singers in the anime, but they also didn&#8217;t appear in the anime either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are probably the singles where Opening and Ending tracks come from, like with a lot of ALI PROJECT's album, as I said above, sometimes an artist is paid for just a portion. Of course, there's nothing stopping an artist building an album around that song as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain BGMs are sometimes actually a number of BGMs from an anime which were split, which is why sometimes there seems to be some songs missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also &lt;em&gt;Character CDs&lt;/em&gt;, which have audio dramas of a character who had an identifiable theme in the anime, plus extra songs. These can normally be identified with the album art focusing on the characters alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are &lt;em&gt;Audio Episodes&lt;/em&gt;, I haven't heard to many (and I only know of the Code Geass ones). They use some tracks from the anime, but they also use music unique to the audio episode.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Dragon Ball Super Krilin uses a t-shirt with a &quot;Tacos&quot; inscription. What does it mean? It's the mexican Tacos food, or is it the japanese &quot;Takos&quot; (which I guess it could also be written tacos which means octopuses which are eaten in Japan) or is it something else?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZfS7V.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZfS7V.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47310">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an interesting question. I would say it's definitely one out of these 3 possibilities, &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It refers to the Japanese word &lt;i&gt;Tako&lt;/i&gt;, ie "Octopus". This word is also a cheeky way of referring to someone's baldness (Example: Tatsumaki uses this word to insult Saitama in One Punch Man(Where the Main character's baldness is a recurring joke)). Krillin's baldness has been made fun of in the show. So this could possibly be a reason for the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mexican dub of Dragon Ball Z was very popular and considered to be one of the best. So perhaps it could be Toei acknowledging them as a fanbase considering they chose &lt;i&gt;"Tacos"&lt;/i&gt; in specific when they could've possibly put anything else on his shirt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps we are thinking too much of it. Just like in countries like the U.S where we see T-shirts with random Japanese Kanji on it, T-Shirts with random English words are indeed popular in Japan. So it was probably randomly chosen.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would like to think they gave it some thought and it was perhaps chosen on account of the first reason. However, it could very likely be for absolutely no reason at all and something only the artists know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="48888" Title="How many years do hero students study at U.A. to become professional heroes?" Body="&lt;p&gt;So far from the anime I remember there is a Class A and a Class B for students, and in episode 24th from season 3, 3 students from a superior year appeared to give a talk to the students from Class A. How many years do hero students study at U.A. until they become professional heroes?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="48896">&lt;h1&gt;3 years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://web-japan.org/kidsweb/explore/schools/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;web-japan.org&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The basic school system in Japan is composed of elementary school (lasting six years), middle school (three years), &lt;strong&gt;high school (three years),&lt;/strong&gt; and university (four years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that U.A. is a high school, we can conclude that students study for three years before graduating and becoming professional heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it may be important to note that in Season 3, Episode 22:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Class 1-A was able to obtain their provisional hero licences, allowing them to do limited work as pro heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing this, this could change the answer to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Under 1 year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If he is referring to someone, then who is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8687">&lt;p&gt;The picture you posted is actually a mistranslation, I have the official English release from Viz manga where Madara says "Of all those who have fought me over the years, there's no one who surpass you at taijutsu!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madara says that Gai is the strongest taijutsu user he has ever faced, and he has faced Hashirama Senju repeatedly in the past in life or death fights, while the latter was in Sage Mode, which pretty much puts you out of everyone else's league immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before he was resurrected people thought Hashirama and Madara's prowess were just legends, which makes sense when you think about how easily Madara defeated all five kages, in theory the top shinobi of each village, in practice some of the top shinobi of each village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you consider that Madara gets his powers from being the reincarnation of Indra, and having absorbed Ashura's chakra to awaken the Rinnegan, and since fighting the Kages he has become the jinchuriki of the ten tails, making him vastly more powerful again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even in this Godly state, Gai's kick is almost enough to kill him, shattering his ribs and arm on one side and making him cough up blood before his healing steps in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gai is the strongest taijutsu user ever, almost without a doubt, his only potential rivals being Madara, Naruto and Sasuke, depending on what they can do with the Sage's chakra. When you consider that Gai is just a normal ninja who isn't a jinchuriki, or a reincarnation of the Sage's children, yet those are the only people who can compare to him, he really is incredibly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

It was filmed at 24 frames per second, in full Cinemascope aspect, using 312 colors in the palette (the richest palette for any hand-done animation ever).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Based on this article, it seems &lt;em&gt;Akira&lt;/em&gt; was the first anime (or perhaps animation) to be filmed at 24fps. Is it the only anime to do so, or did others do this later on as well?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="3835">&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell (according to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Practically all hand-drawn animation is designed to be played at 24 FPS. Actually hand-drawing 24 unique frames per second ("1's") is costly. Even in big budget films usually hand-draw animation shooting on "2's" (one hand-drawn frame is shown twice, so only 12 unique frames per second)[6] and some animation is even drawn on "4's" (one hand-drawn frame is shown four times, so only six unique frames per second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sources (of varying degrees of reliability) say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Japanimation runs at an average of 24 frames per second, with main objects animated at 8 to 12 fps and background objects as low as 6 to 8 fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Decent/high quality animation in general is done at the 24 frames/second rate (this also includes animation in other mediums, such as claymation and CG'd work). Now, depending on the 'look' and 'feel' they are aiming for--all of those 24 frames may be slightly different (in succession) than each other, to give 'movement' to the object on the screen (as in, none of the frames look exactly alike. There are slight variations between all frames), or only 12 of them may be different from each other--every other frame (in succession with each other) being varied, with an exact copy of the last frame before it acting as the &#8216;filler&#8217; frame. So it's like 12 pairs of different frames--the first frame in each set varied from the last and its copy behind it to lengthen the time the image is on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.animenation.net/forums/showthread.php?t=201462"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general consensus, from the little that I can find, is that most anime now seem to have a frame rate of 24, but they often are 2s, which means that every frame is doubled so there are 12 unique frames per second. For example, a torrent site for Claymore lists the frame rate as 23.9, which is really 24 fps. So to conclude, Akira is not the only anime to be produced at 24fps.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="12748">&lt;p&gt;As can probably be seen by the response, the way the question is made can lead to misleading answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akira was filmed completely using 24 distinct images per second to achieve 24 frames per second. This is normally called "shooting on ones", where no frames are repeated consecutively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most animation is done "on twos", which mean 12 distinct images per second are used to achieve 24 frames per second, by repeating as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Anime is done from 2 to 12 distinct images per second to achieve 24 frames per second, by repeating as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Quality studios usually use a mix, having some animation running on ones but the majority of the feature running on twos (Ghibly, for example, does this a lot, usually it's very obvious in the smoothness of the animation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akira is the most famous animated full feature done in "true" 24fps for the whole length of the movie. I'd argue the other most famous one is the unreleased "The Thief and the Cobbler", partly due to its bizarre history and partly because when talking about the fact that it's done "on ones" is always mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the answer to your question is, if taken literally, that no, it's not the only one "filmed" at 24fps (most, if not all, are). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to your actual question is "yes", as it's the only full-length anime production &lt;strong&gt;animated&lt;/strong&gt; on ones, at the full 24fps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on whether you want to consider "The Thief and the Cobbler" (being as it is unreleased), it is the only "modern" (post-1950) full-length animated feature &lt;strong&gt;animated&lt;/strong&gt; on ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would've given the willfully obtuse answer to your literal question instead of your intended question, but I see that's been done already :)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="28417" Title="Raye Penber's fianc&#233;e's part opens up a loophole in DeathNote" Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raye Penber's fianc&#233;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; who had come to give the tip about Kira (she deduced most of the Kira's tactics even before L!), and Light Yagami's encounter was missed by the receptionist/L at the police head quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both were seen discussing about telling her theory to Light's father in front of the two receptionist before she became missing. Most police head quarters have CCTV cameras attached, so it should have been used by the police to get a clue about her before she went missing the day she visited the police. If she was alive after that day, she would have tried to visit the police head quarters again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As per receptionists/ CCTV cameras she was last seen with Light and Light offering her to give the tip, so he can on behalf of her tell it to his father, even offering his phone. At least the initial investigation should have started with interrogating Light about her. How was this scenario missed by L and his Team? Is this not a goof?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28577">&lt;p&gt;L probably did not notice any of it because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not automatically remember her name, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If L would have found that and saw that Light was the last one with her while she was alive, he &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have arrested him. However, they were in a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; city, so they wouldn't have had evidence that it was &lt;strong&gt;Light&lt;/strong&gt; that killed her. Also, if L &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; arrest him, the entire story would have been shorter and not as fun as it is now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</answer><answer Id="28580">&lt;p&gt;To L and the investigators, Naomi Misora is only missing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Light writes down Naomi's name, resulting in her death by suicide. Her body is never found due to the specifications made by Light in the Death Note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Naomi_Misora#Plot" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Naomi Misora - Plot (Last Paragraph)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Light specified that she would commit suicide and when L sees Naomi's photo they still don't know that Kira can kill besides a heart attack, there's no way to connect Naomi's disappearance to Kira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If L was to take a leap of faith and pull out the CCTV footage showing Light with Naomi, what can they do then? Light had a legitimate reason for being at Police Headquarters (in fact it was by pure chance that Light ran into her there, it wasn't planned like with Raye) and if they questioned him, Light could just as easily said he noticed that she seemed depressed and tried to help her which would backup the suicide if they discovered her body.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41095">&lt;p&gt;But Light did kill other criminals (he states so in ep. 7) using suicide, so L should have at least suspected this possibility and then confirmed his theory when he finds out that Raye Penber's wife goes missing, him knowing that she was previously an FBI agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He should have then checked where she was seen last and then connected the dots to Kira. Light may be able to talk his way out of this but L should at least question/suspect him of this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41402">&lt;p&gt;The more pertinent question is why Raye Penber would show his ID to Light in the first place considering L secretly tapped the FBI to help with the investigation. L didn't want the Japanese police to know he was investigating them since it would cause friction, and the FBI was aware of this which is why they were there in secret. Thus, the FBI agent would have avoided showing the DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT'S SON his ID at all costs to make sure their presence in Japan remained a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the only plothole I've seen in the show that makes no sense. Other than that, it seems like a perfect story!&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="47577" Title="Why is Midoriya's power so low according to the official character book?" Body="&lt;p&gt;According to the official character book or &lt;em&gt;Boku no Hero Academia&lt;/em&gt; Wikia, Midoriya power is 1/5. However, other students have powers much higher than him:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yuga 2/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tenya 4/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Eijiro 4/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Denki 3/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fumikage 2/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Shoto 5/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Katsuki 5/5&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't make sense. Midoriya is supposed to have the most powerful quirk, One for All. In the battle with Shoto, when they clashed, they were almost even. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How does this power level from the official character book makes sense? I could understand if he doesn't have 6/5 (like All Might) but maybe 5/5 like Shoto or Katsuki or 4/5 (barely under Shoto since in their battle they clashed and Shoto won for a little), but certainly not 1/5.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why is Midoriya power so low according to the official character book?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47578">&lt;p&gt;Official character book only covers between Chapters 1 to 88. This is where All Might and other heroes assault the League of Villains to save Bakugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you consider fights that Midoriya was in, until there, I think you can see the pattern. Midoriya usually breaks his bones while fighting. Yes, there are some fights where he doesn't, but not that much. The fight between him and Muscular is a good example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you defeat someone that is so powerful but destroy yourself in the process, that makes you a liability. You defeated one big guy, good. But if a low-tier villain can one-shot you after that fight, could you really call yourself that powerful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of people know that Midoriya inherited One for All. To others, he is not super powerful. The Tournament Arc is a good example of it. How many pro heroes were willing to recruit him?    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49051">&lt;p&gt;I think that the stats on power are based on how much power that the person can control and not based on the overall power that the person&#8217;s quirk has. Bakugo has full control over his quirk but Midoriya barely does. He&#8217;s getting there though.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="50369">&lt;p&gt;I think the reason is that Deku didn't have control over his power. Only a few people know that Deku is really powerful but he can only use 20% of his power right now. However, other people consider him weak because they assume that his power is kind of ok, though it breaks his bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would give him a 3/5 power and 5/5 speed. Even though they list his speed 1/5, Muscular said that he is very fast. He demonstrated good control over his speed.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Since Eight Tails is still outside (in dream) rather than in Gedo Statue, is Madara's Ten Tails Jinchuriki Mode complete?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am talking about episode when Madara takes all the beasts into the Gedo statue and become the Sage of Six Paths. The Eight Tails was swapped with one of its tails to escape. As Eight Tails is not completely inside the Gedo statue, how can Madara come to Ten Tails Jinchuriki full form?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="27775">&lt;p&gt;Yes, Madara's Ten Tails Jinchuriki Mode is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gedo Statue drew in all the beasts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a Tailed Beast is removed from its host, the host dies. To avoid this from happening, there should be enough chakra of the Tailed Beast left inside the jinchuriki. When Gyuki was being removed, he sectioned one of his tentacles, having chakra, to Bee. This was done so to ensure Bee survives without the majority of &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Gy%C5%ABki" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gyuki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Struggling against its confines, Gy&#363;ki apologised to B as it was extracted and sealed within the statue along with the other tailed beasts, but not before cutting off one of its tentacles, letting B survive through the chakra within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the majority of Gyuki was absorbed into the statue and only a portion of it was intact with Bee. That portion served as a source of life for Bee and it was negligible compared to the intake of Eight Tails chakra into the statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, since the statue contained most of the Eight Tails chakra, Madara was able to undergo the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="4943" Title="Are anime more popular in terms of viewership and revenue than Western cartoons?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if anime are more popular than Western cartoons - &lt;strong&gt;in terms of viewership and revenue&lt;/strong&gt; - as I couldn't find any information on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there has been any significantly large survey on this. What about manga vs comics?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4995">&lt;p&gt;No. Up until now Japanese anime have never been in the popular spotlight compared to works for Western animation. Anime can be described as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine"&gt;"pulpy" format&lt;/a&gt;, often cheaply made, heavily-formulated, low critical respect and scrutiny. Though what makes anime unique is it's meta-genre. There are a lot of ideas in it's story templates the that are not typically seen or are non-existent in Western media culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Animation in the West&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of Western animation companies, like Disney for an example, don't just treat their works as a product, but as a brand. The better their brand looks to consumers, the better marketability the company will have with related works and products (they spend a lot on PR, marketing, lawyers, focus groups, etc, to ensure this). There's a lot of oversight involved is western animation, in order to ensure a better quality product, which typically drives up the cost of production. Of course, this all to ensure that their product is a successful as possible, in order to make obscene amounts of cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Animation in the East&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a ever growing community of anime fans out there, who like anime for one reason or another (e.g., characters vs. story), but few people typically care about the specifics of anime. In anime, the stakeholders are more concerned about the overall final product than any given piece of it, the product hits the main selling points of the formula (e.g., fighting, boobs, robot, X-dere character, harem cast, etc.), it's good to go. With anime there's a general lack of oversight, which typically leads to low expectations of the audience and from them as well. However the pulpy aspect of Anime allows authors a much higher level of freedom as they are free to explored new ideas, as long as they meet the initial criteria of the stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On Popular Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pulpiness is the same as what webcomics (modern comic book heroes starred in this pulpy format) and indie games are to us in these modern times. There are tons of these all around, most of it is forgettable, but occasionally there's that polished gem that can really good interesting, funny, charming and/or inventive stuff (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Azumanga Daioh, Serial Experiments Lain, Baccano!&lt;/em&gt;). There's a lot of opportunities to fail, learn, and innovate, but at the same time the barriers for entry are lower and turnover is usually higher compared to similar works of western animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewership and revenue are often a by-product of the popularity of a given brand. Just like really popular mainstream movies or games will always make a profit, no matter how good or bad it might be (e.g., the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series, the new &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; movies). Western animation has built a brand image and following through it's popularity, and in order to sustain it's overwhelming popularity, there's a lot of scrutiny from both the audience and stakeholder to maintain a certain image and status within popular culture. We don't typically see this with anime, so it gives us an idea that anime specifically is not really up there in the mainstream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we see a lot of people on TV and the Internet proclaiming themselves to be "geeks" openly (whether they are or not is another thing), so there's not a whole lot to be said about anime and the otaku subculture. One can say they are a gamer ("I'm a huge gamer") or a TV show/movie ("I'm a big Disney/Pixar/Spongebob/Avatar fan"), but there are very few people come out about anime. This leads us to believe that anime hasn't reach the tipping point where it can be considered acceptable, like the other forms of western animation.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="4997">&lt;p&gt;Disney's &lt;em&gt;Wreck-It Ralph&lt;/em&gt; - $471,222,889 (worldwide revenue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghibli's last two movies (&lt;em&gt;The Secret World of Arrietty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea&lt;/em&gt;) - $202,614,288 + $145,570,827 = $348,185,115 (worldwide revenue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, based on a very small sample (not statistically valid), I'd say western animated movies make a whole lot more money than Japanese anime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Logan and Krazer pointed out, it's probably an apples and oranges comparison. Disney spends a whole lot more money on their movies than Ghibli does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not even going to attempt to do a comparison on Cartoon Network vs ATX or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="46466">&lt;p&gt;I don't think no one will understand the hypocrisy in this, we talk about animes being comparatively less popular to American cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very deep reason for that state of liking, this is because most of the viewers are from the western part of the world (except the anime producing country; Japan). In Asia, it doesn't go alike for both adults and kids. So, comparatively the viewership is high enough in most of the western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the judgment not fair and obviously, it goes in the favour of American cartoons even though there is a huge fanship for animes globally. An anime is a must-watch piece of art, people should go for it, but an American cartoon is given to you when you were kids. It's like some hit channels in most of the countries are highly likely to show American cartoons than many of the animes.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="34257" Title="How does Guy know how to perform the jutsu in the Eight Gates Released Formation?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I know that if you open the 8th Gate, you will get enormously powerful but at the end you will die.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that case, how did Guy know Jutsu that can be performed in that state, given that against Madara was the first time he ever opened it? You can't just invent new Jutsu on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34261">&lt;p&gt;Though this is a bit dissapointing, we do not fully know the truth. We do know for a fact that Guy's Father &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Might_Duy" rel="nofollow"&gt;Duy&lt;/a&gt; was in the same situation as he was, but was weaker (the eternal genin). He learned the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Eight_Gates" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eight gates&lt;/a&gt; from an unknown source. Duy claims it took him 20 years to master the eight gates. The only piece of knoledge we have on the subject is simply summarized to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By undergoing intense training, one can learn how to open these gates allowing the user to surpass their own physical limits at the cost of extreme damage to their own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same paragraph on the wiki, the Gates &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;limit the overall flow of chakra within a person's body. The basis for the idea of the chakra gates comes from the body's limits on the functions within it. This makes the body much weaker, but it keeps the body from expiring too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we know that the Gates are simply, Literally, Chakra limiters, and Chakra flow increases strength, speed, and other physical traits. In the anime, it is shown that to open the gates, you need only Overload them, which forces them open. Therefor, it does make sense that one who spends years if not decades training intensely, like Duy or Guy, would eventually accidentally overload the first one. it is also possible to do so if they are in battle in a critical moment. Either way, Knowing there are gates (sharinan and byakugan can see chakra flow, so they can probably also see the gates) and learning they can be opened through force is probably all you need to open at least the first 7. Guy has been shown to open several at once, and for the first 7 only ever had to clench his muscles to do so. The first 7 can probably just be opened by sheer force which can be learned and mastered by training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem then is simply the 8th gate, which is shown to require a puncture to the gate itself, which is located in the heart. The issue is simply how they could figure that out. As we know, there has only been one master of the gates at a time, so there are 2 likely senarios, either 1, they watch their master use it (Guy knew his dad was going to use the 8th gate against the 7 Ninja Swordsman) and witnessed it, realizing that was the key to opening the gate. The second idea is simply that they cant force it open, either through lack of training (to not risk accidentally activating it) or its just locked that hard, and the puncture works to make it easier to open. If you know about openin the first 7, it is completely understandable that you would figure out how to make it easier to open, though I doubt you want to puncture yourself every time, except when you do not expect to live long without doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing to think about is the Moves he uses. Well like almost every move besides Rasen Shuriken were invented off screen. By who and what we do not know, But what is clear is that Guy can not use Ninjutsu, as well as Lee. Every Jutsu they used was some kind of Taijutsu, usually a simple punch or kick, sometimes enhanced with the power of the Gates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Morning_Peacock" rel="nofollow"&gt;Morning Peacock&lt;/a&gt; was simply punches so fast that the air friction alone set them ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Daytime_Tiger" rel="nofollow"&gt;Daytime Tiger&lt;/a&gt; merely used the strength to compress a massive amount of air into a very small point, then release it in a massive shockwave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Evening_Elephant" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evening Elephant&lt;/a&gt; was to create air cannons with your punches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Night_Guy" rel="nofollow"&gt;Night Guy&lt;/a&gt; Was nothing more than a Chakra enhanced Super kick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, all these moves are Simple punches or kicks, which could be performed at lower or any level, with or without gates, but with reduced effectiveness. Like most forbidden Jutsu, They were also likely written down in scrolls, recorded as useful/effective moves, but with high risks attached. It only takes one time to test a move, and one survivor to record it. We also know Might Duy had reached all 8 gates, so he could also have had time to invent some of these moves. Beyond that, We are just looking at fairly simple moves, for a guy that is undeniably a Genius Taijutsu specialist, and only 2 of them are doable in the 8th gate, both of which are just a punch and Kick, simple moves in principle.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34281">&lt;p&gt;Okay, it's hard to explain, and i might not even be right, but I'll try my best. Sadly, there's no tldr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's different?&lt;/strong&gt; Guy didn't invent the jutsu in the sense that Kakashi invented the Chidori. Kakashi spent years perfecting it. It's something he initially needed to use hand signs to perform every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The jutsus (more specifically taijutsu techniques) Guy used &#8212; Evening Elephant (Sekizo) and Night Guy &#8212; are byproducts of attacking with all eight gates opened. It's not something you have to learn; it's something you are just able to do with that much power flooding from your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jutsu are just names he used to describe the phenomenon of having incredibly OP punches and kicks that can also generate a dragon-like aura (for some reason). He didn't actually know what would happen, unless he witnessed his dad do the same thing and he told Rock Lee what it was like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence From Narutopedia (&lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Evening_Elephant" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Sekizo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Night_Guy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Night Guy&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Evening Elephant ... can be performed by those users who have
  opened all Eight Gates.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The Night Guy ... can only be performed by
  opening all Eight Gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^ They imply that it's something that you can naturally do with the eight gates opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Guy initiates the technique, he emits an enormous amount of
  chakra ... the blood vapour of the Eighth Gate manifests into a red,
  flickering dragon-like aura ... He then dashes forward at such an
  extreme speed that the space within the immediate vicinity of the
  technique is distorted, making it impossible for the target to defend
  against it. Guy then deals an immensely powerful kick which carries
  such force that it is capable of obliterating the target's body...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^ Essentially, Guy is gathering power, running really fast, and kicking really hard. That's not really something that you have to practice and invent, like the Rasen-shuriken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt; Kinda like when Obito and Madara became the Ten-tails Jinchuriki. They could do all this fancy truth-seeking ball stuff. Not because they spent time learning it, but because they were just able to, with the help of Ten-tails and huge sage power. Or when Naruto was able to heal people and Sasuke was able to teleport as soon as they got Hagoromo's chakra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigh...&lt;/strong&gt; Nevertheless, there are too many caveats and exceptions in the Naruto universe. Everything they say isn't necessarily true (e.g. Gaara's absolute defence is not absolute, Hashirama's unique wood release can be used by several other people). I mean, your first sentence is refuted by the fact that Guy actually survived (thanks to Naruto). So it's quite hard to make sense of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More info -&lt;/strong&gt; If you're not satisfied, look at this guy's explanation, which is good in the sense that it uses common sense: &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20957/how-do-you-train-in-a-jutsu-that-kills-you-if-used"&gt;How do you train in a jutsu that kills you if used?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34359">&lt;p&gt;To understand how Guy managed to master the Hachimon Tonkou (Eight Gates Release Formation), let us take a look to how jutsus are learned in Narutoverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 ways a jutsu can be learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn it from a teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn it from a scroll/book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn it yourself (a.k.a. invent it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn it from a teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be the easiest way to learn a jutsu. You have a teacher teach you how to perform a certain jutsu. Most ninja learn jutsu this way through the academy. Example of jutsus learned through this method: Bunshin no Jutsu, Kawarimi no Jutsu, Sasuke learning Chidori from Kakashi, Naruto learning Rasengan from Jiraiya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn it from a scroll/book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a method that is harder than the first method. You learn it from a book. I no longer have the copy with me but my father used to have a book that teaches kungfu moves. In that book there are explanations and illustrations on how to perform certain moves. You learn the techniques by performing as the book says. Example of jutsus learned through this method: Naruto learning Kage Bunshin no Jutsu, Orochimaru learning various jutsus using scrolls he stole from the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn it yourself (a.k.a. invent it)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method might be the hardest of the 3. You learn the jutsu by creating it yourself. You can invent it through seeing natural phenomena or other people performing a certain jutsu, copy it and change several aspects of it to make your own jutsu using the same principles. Example of jutsus learned through this method: Minato learning Rasengan, Kakashi learning Chidori/Raikiri, Naruto learning Rasen Shuriken, Tobirama learning Kage Bunshi no Jutsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Guy knows how to perform jutsus in the Hachimon Tonkou?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this we need to identify how Guy learned the jutsu and his training method. Guy learned the jutsu from Might Duy, his father. Guy's training method consists of &lt;strong&gt;extreme physical training&lt;/strong&gt;, such as walking around the village for 500 laps using his hands, thousands sit ups and &lt;strong&gt;image training&lt;/strong&gt;. The image training was mentioned in the manga (and perhaps the anime as well) as one of methods he used to train himself with the reasoning being training his ability to predict enemy movements. Guy also trains by sparring with Kakashi to enhance his &lt;strong&gt;fighting senses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Hachimon Tonkou is a taijutsu, let's talk about real life taijutsu training. Taijutsu in real world, such as Kungfu, Karate, Kendo are mastered through training the said moves. A complete newbie can perform Iai Slash, but they would perform it badly as they only copy the movement in general. What differentiates a master from those newbies is that they &lt;strong&gt;perform the same move over and over through training&lt;/strong&gt; until they can use the move with super precision (perfect foot-steps, sword drawing timing, slashing direction, power, speed). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might Guy &lt;strong&gt;might learned&lt;/strong&gt; the jutsus used in Hachimon Tonkou by learning the moves itself &lt;strong&gt;in normal state or 7th gate release state&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the closest he can get to without killing himself. He learned the jutsu by training the moves over and over in the 7th gate release state while also doing image training since he can't perform the jutsu for real. Combining that with the points I bold above and fighting sense honed through experience of real combat and sparring with one of the best shinobi ever (Hatake Kakashi), it is very possible for him to perform the jutsus splendidly despite that being the very first time he used it for real because he already mastered the basics to perform that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the same as when you do a chemistry practical test at school despite knowing only the theory (including the steps). Can you do it? Yes, but it might be a bit sloppy since you never do it for real. If you have practiced the movements (pouring the chemicals, measuring it, using the pipette) using a substitute liquid (like water for example) you would be able to perform it greatly even if that was the first time you use the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="25763" Title="Mechanics of the Inuyasha love triangle?" Body="&lt;p&gt;A large portion of the &lt;em&gt;InuYasha&lt;/em&gt; manga and anime series deals with the emotional issues surrounding the primary love triangle of &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; Inuyasha, Kagome, and Kikyo, particularly from Kagome's point of view. However, it is revealed that Kagome is, in fact, a &lt;strong&gt;reincarnation&lt;/strong&gt; of Kikyo, so they actually share the same soul, albeit from different time periods!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If that's the case, then this appears to remove all of the tension and underlying conflict, in effect Inuyasha is in love with&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; the same person (in two forms, one of which is even a vengeful spirit of the dead who wants to move on the afterlife)!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How exactly was this love triangle supposed to work, narratively? While I can't speak for the mangaka's inner thoughts, perhaps there are cultural nuances or tropes that I'm not aware of at work here?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="25766">&lt;p&gt;The mechanics work like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha is in love with Kikyo. She is the first human since his mother that treats him well. Despite Kikyo killing him and sealing him to the great tree, he still loves her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kagome falls in love with Inuyasha at first sight, but he doesn't like her at all. When he firsts revives from death, he thinks it is Kikyo, but once he figures out she is someone different, he doesn't care for her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to framing plot reasons, Kagome and Inuyasha have to work together to save the world. Inuyasha slowly starts to warm up to Kagome over time, as she overcomes the dead Kikyo's shadow. Then Kikyo gets resurrected (as a walking dead corpse). This causes Inuyasha's cooling love for Kikyo to flame strongly again, and causing him to be torn between his first love (Kikyo) and has new growing love (Kagome). However, his loyalties are first to Kikyo, so Kagome always loses out when he must choose between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha's first loyalty is what prevents Kagome from being able to "seal the deal" with him, and is a hurdle she can never overcome as long as the animated dead Kikyo is around. No matter how close Kagome and Inuyasha become over time (in the main series), he will desert Kagome to run off and save Kikyo if he thinks Kikyo is in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="34233">&lt;p&gt;Reincarnation is tricky business and there are so many opinions what changes when a soul returns in another body. The gender or character can be different from the previous version, so no wonder Inuyasha treats the two girls as different entities. Also there are shared history and memories between Inuyasha and Kikyo which are very precious to him. There is also guilt that he couldn't protect her and a promise he made and intends to keep, while Kagome at first is a complete stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that, I am not sure Kagome being and looking similar wasn't a contributing factor for Inuyasha falling for her. She even had the same talents: both women have miko powers. Maybe on same level he did preceive their relationship as some kind of second chance with Kikyo.
He shows no romantic interest in other females, but he does with Kagome pretty early on, even saying she smells nice and when Kagome says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"I thought you didn&#8217;t like my scent"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha replies with 
'I lied'. Which is curious, especially as at their first encounter he confuses her with Kikyo based on her scent. He says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Who else would give off a scent like you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inu is a dog hanyou, so olfactory perception is extremely important for him,  and if his nose senses that Kikyo and Kagome aren't that different then maybe he did preceive Kagome as Kikyo. But then the 'real' Kikyo returned,  which messed Inuyasha up quite a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My impression was that in some instances he'd preferred to stay with Kagome and not, say, die with Kikyo, but he felt that abandoning her wouldn't be fair.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36667">&lt;p&gt;Honestly, yes, it is true that Kikyo and Kagome share a soul, but they have different personalities. Kikyo was someone Inuyasha once trusted and grew attached to her because of her personality (not just because she held the sacred jewel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kagome, on the other hand, is from a whole-another world. Inuyasha grew attached to Kagome for her personality and many other aspects. Inuyasha forgot about Kikyo until she was resurected from clay and bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's a very confusing triangle of love.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37157">&lt;p&gt;I agree with the existing answers, except Kagome isn't just Kikyo's reincarnation. If you go deeper, you'll find that she is a multi-reincarnation, though it appears Inuyasha goes after Kagome because she has some similarities to Kikyo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of that is true, he also likes her because she is herself. Kagome has convinced herself of this, thus she has proved that she does not live in Kikyo's shadow, she actually surpasses Kikyo in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true that Kikyo is the first human besides his mother to treat him kindly, but she also only loved his human-side since that was the first side she met him in, so she suggested that he become a human and that they live together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the second movie, Kagome clearly states "to be who you are" and that "she loves him as a half demon", and she even chose to stay with him when he was having trouble with his full demon side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kagome loves Inuyasha the ways he is, but Inuyasha at times still sees her as Kikyo.     &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49291">&lt;p&gt;While in the beginning and through the series, Inuyasha does tend to break Kagome&#8217;s heart more than once, she always comes back. And again, it's true that he loved Kikyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view though, it was companionship that he mistook for loving Kikyo. With Kagome, he didn&#8217;t like her at first, but as time went on, she became his friend, then in &lt;em&gt;InuYasha: The Final Act&lt;/em&gt;, she becomes his wife (and possibly mate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we rewind to the Band of Seven when Kagome, Sango, and Miroku were poisoned, Inuyasha cried thinking he lost Kagome, and if we rewind again to the previous episode, then we can clearly see that he&#8217;s worried she ain&#8217;t gonna make it causing him to use the wind scar to extinguish the fire getting them out of danger. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="49306">&lt;p&gt;One of the big things divides Kagome and Kikyo, particularly after Kikyo's death, is Kagome's selflessness. She goes out of her way to help those that are in distress, even when she might benefit from letting them die instead- particularly in the scene where Kagome jumps into the pond to purify Kikyo's spirit. She was never thanked for it, and she didn't gain from it, but she did it anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing they share is their courage- even when faced with adversity, you don't see Kikyo and Kagome backing down- and if Kikyo does, it's more of an "I don't wanna do it" thing than it is "I'm too afraid."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kikyo is dignified and introspective, whereas Kagome is gregarious and spirited. Inspecting Inuyasha's demeanor, he is the kind of person that likes to portray himself as careless and tough, but has a gentle heart (like when Kagome says "I hate you" after saving Kikyo's life when Naraku's evil energy had begun to taint her, and Inuyasha admits that it hurt him, whereas Kagome barely remembered saying it) which he reveals through his willingness to step up to the plate and defend others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love Inuyasha and Kikyo was brief and hot-blooded, sweet and transient like daylight in an Arctic winter. On the other hand, the bond he built with Kagome was something they built via adversity, blood and tears shed together, providing and caring for one another, and TIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while Kikyo before her death was a lively person, post-mortem she is only quite literally a shell of herself, as she only has a tiny fragment of her and Kagome's shared soul stored inside of a clay body (from when the witch brought her back from the dead and Kagome's body absorbed most of the soul back into herself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's notable, however, that Inuyasha was with Kikyo out of choice, and went back to her out of choice, as when he followed her tree to tree, spoke with her, and agreed voluntarily to meet her at the Tree of Ages to give up his demon half. He has no choice where it comes to Kagome- she was thrust into his life and even uses the Beads of Subjugation around his neck for vengeful and immature purposes and to restrain his wild nature- they were something that Kikyo ultimately decided she didn't need for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha and Kikyo were two lonely souls, Kikyo out of the solemn duty to the Shikon Jewel, and Inuyasha because neither the community of demons nor humans would accept him as one of their own. They found kinship, community, and companionship in each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kagome accepted Inuyasha unconditionally. She shows open affection and worry for him, like when she ran toward him in the episode where Inuyasha plummeted over the cliff and she was unsure if he'd been able to survive the fall. The experiences they have shared are numerous, diverse, and impactful- the battles they've been in, the lands they've traveled, and the arguments they've had and resolved. You guys have seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole love triangle thing makes me mad sometimes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="55483">&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha was in love with Kikyo and when you truly love someone, a bad experience from that person can't make the feelings just go away --- BUT that doesn't mean that it won't be tainted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he met Kagome, he hated her because he thought she was Kikyo who sealed him to the tree. It's actually possible to hate someone you love. Love ignites hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, Inuyasha was slowly forgetting Kikyo and became close with Kagome. Friendship is the foundation of their relationship. And friendship is a strong one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, didn't take long, Kikyo was resurrected by Urasue. Yes, Inuyasha got confused. But still, Kagome was in good standing because Inuyasha was already fond of her the time they first discovered that Kikyo was still around using dead souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Kikyo was a changed woman. Her behavior had nothing to do with the little amount of soul she got from Kagome. Remember she reclaimed it in full but she's still very angry. It's normal because she thought she was betrayed by the only man he loved. And change happens all the time to every woman who felt betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After resurrection, she wasn't the same Kikyo that Inuyasha once loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that in real life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only know the person's face and name but everything including her actions and the way she talks was unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha remembers the past. The way it felt. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering is different from what you actually feel. You may jump back to memory lane at times but it will only last a few moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will never leave Kagome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT, Inuyasha is a good person. He must've felt guilty every time he remembers Kikyo suffered living, died and still suffering alone --- while he isn't, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried to cut tie with Kagome, because he thought he owe Kikyo his own life but can't fully decide to do it. He was hesitant. Then he met Kagome and admitted he shouldn't be having fun because Kikyo is suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coz he's not suffering. Means he was over his love for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the feeling of loneliness when you and the one you love are apart? But he wasn't lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inuyasha is not suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is having fun with his new friends, especially knowing that Kagome's around and safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I'm sure is he'll be really lonely if it's Kagome who's gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loved Kikyo. It's a thing from his past and a part of him that can never be erased. He wants his first love to be remembered a great woman. He wants to protect her, including her memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And watching Inuyasha over and over again made me realized that the 3 of them are all good people --Kikyo, Inuyasha &amp;amp; Kagome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kikyo didn't talk much about her feelings but you'll see through her actions that she later made up her mind and decided to not do anything about her feelings with Inuyasha, but instead serve other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Kikyo doesn't want Kagome gone. She doesn't want Kagome to replace her as Inuyasha's past as she can't be his future either. She thinks rationally. She and Kagome are the same on that manner. And she love Inuyasha too much she doesn't want him to be lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Kagome gets jealous and all because she's only human but still saved Kikyo a few times. She respect her as the first woman in Inuyasha's life. 
1. Kagome didn't let Miroku carry Kikyo to Mt. Hakurei barrier's boundary.
2. She let Inuyasha leave to look for Kikyo's remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She's the perfect version of Kikyo. 
She's exactly what Kikyo subconsciously wished to be.
Both nice girl.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="23286" Title="What's written behind the makeshift club sign?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't know if you answer these type of questions, but it would help if you could answer this. Japanese schools have signs outside their rooms. For example, there's &#36039;&#26009;&#23460; for &quot;resource room&quot;. In the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi!, the opening sequence shows a sign that is covered with a piece of paper by the words &quot;&#23398;&#22290;&#29983;&#27963;&#37096;&quot;. This anime is apparently extremely misleading in its content, and I was wondering whether the words behind it were a reference to something in the anime. Do you know if you can figure out what the words might be? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The picture is attached below:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4eJd.png&quot; alt=&quot;sign&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="23287">&lt;p&gt;The original sign is &#29983;&#24466;&#20250;&#23460; &lt;em&gt;seitokai-shitsu&lt;/em&gt; "student council room". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't read the manga, so I can only presume that their club has co-opted what was formerly the student council office as their headquarters for some reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I guess this is something of a tip-off to the episode 1 twist - it's weird that another club would just up and occupy the student council office, after all.)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="8177" Title="How do Luffy's Gear attacks work?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Might just be me missing an explanation part in the manga, or just not properly understanding at the time. But how does Luffy's Gear 2nd and 3rd attacks work? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/K2yHr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8179">&lt;p&gt;It's explained right there in the manga, and it's due to Luffy's rubber body &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gear 2nd  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luffy uses his rubber body like a pump, to pump the blood through his system quicker. This strengthens his abilities. It's also not healthy for his body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gear 3rd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luffy bites a hole in himself, and then blows up a part of his body like a balloon.  He is able to increase the size of his body this way (and since air actually does have mass, he increases the effective mass of his blows too). The first few times Luffy had done this, it has left him small briefly after using it, but apparently, this has stopped happening. He probably learned to do it without becoming small during the time skip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8180">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He circulates more blood in his veins by using his legs (or arms) as a pump. This fast blood stream would shatter blood veins of a normal human. But since Luffy's body acts like "gomu", his veins stretch and make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear 3rd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He bites a part of his body (usually his finger) to open a hole there. Next he inhales huge amounts of air into his lungs by stretching them. Then he blows this wind through the hole he opened to bloat up his body. So that his body looks bigger.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, by doing this his body mass wouldn't increase very much, so he shouldn't be able to throw enormously powerful punches in real world dynamics as animated.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8220">&lt;p&gt;To add to the other answers here, it's important to note one of the reasons why Gear Second works - one of Luffy's &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" rel="nofollow"&gt;Required Secondary Powers&lt;/a&gt; is to generate excess blood as he needs it. (This is how he can expand his limbs without oxygen starving any tissue/drastically changing his blood pressure/etc.) From TVTropes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Luffy can bleed so much without dying because one of his secondary
  powers is a circulatory system that can make extra blood
  instantaneously to pump into his stretched out limbs. In fact, his
  rubberized organs, bones, and indeed every single vital part of his
  anatomy is the only reason he is able to withstand the stresses
  inherent in his Gear Second Super Mode. According to Rob Lucci, if
  anyone but Luffy were to use something like Gear Second, their heart
  would explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="12848">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Gomu_Gomu_no_Mi/Gear_Second_Techniques" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gear Second&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h114P.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h114Pm.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With gear second, Luffy increases his blood circulation by pumping his blood through his body at higher speeds than normal. A normal human wouldn't be able to withstand this kind of pressure on its veins' walls. If Luffy wasn't a rubber boy, they would burst. The increase in blood flow results in a higher discharge of red blood cells, which provide the human body with oxygen and nutrients. The additional oxygen and nutrients would make the muscles work more efficiently and thus result in higher speed and power. In sports this process is called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_doping" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;blood doping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In blood doping, the discharge is increased by adding additional red blood cells, which were extracted at an earlier time, instead of letting them flow faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gear second also comes with &lt;strong&gt;side affects&lt;/strong&gt;. The extreme oxygen usage would result in an acceleration of his breathing and the increase in his metabolism causes him to be hungrier than usual or even have a paralysis type effect after prolonged use of it, like in the second fight with Rob Lucci. Due to the acceleration and thus friction inside his body, he turns quite hot, which results in his sweat evaporating right off his body. This explains the smoke and redness of his skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luffy obviously needs to keep pumping or the effect wears off. As it would deplete his energy storage quite rapidly, he doesn't use gear second constantly during fights. The increase in metabolism might also affect his life expectancy as mentioned by Rob Lucci.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Gomu_Gomu_no_Mi/Gear_Third_Techniques" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gear Third&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qx25L.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qx25Lm.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With gear third, Luffy bites into his thumb joint, making a small opening, and blows very hard into it, which inflates his arm. He blows the &lt;strong&gt;air inside his bones&lt;/strong&gt; and since our skeleton fully connects all our joints, he can then rearrange the amounts of air as he pleases through his body, without releasing it accidentally. Luffy basically pushes the air towards his hands, stretching his body, but also increasing the air-pressure. This would result in Luffy having a larger area of attack (eg: the size of a giant's hand), and an increased hardness due to the air pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the time-skip we can see how Luffy decreased the size of his arms, but focused solely on the point of contact. He pushed all the air in his hands, increasing the &lt;strong&gt;air pressure and thus hardness&lt;/strong&gt; of his attacks. The air in his arms would be wasted otherwise anyway. Also since it is air he is carrying, it doesn't cost him much additional strength to move those large hands, but the additional damage done due to the vast increase in area of attack is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gear third also comes with &lt;strong&gt;side affects&lt;/strong&gt;. Before the time-skip, we could see Luffy become tiny after using this attack. After attacking, Luffy blows out all additional air, resulting in a rapid decrease of body size. The rapid decrease and massive amounts of energy needed to inflate and keep the air where he likes it, makes him unable to retain his original size. I think it is mainly due to the energy he needs to position the air where he wants and keep it there, since Luffy didn't shrink after using his balloon attack. After the timeskip and training with Rayleigh, Luffy became strong enough to keep his body intact after using the 3rd Gear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Gomu_Gomu_no_Mi/Gear_Fourth_Techniques" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gear Fourth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 With gear fourth, Luffy, similarly to gear third, bites down on his body and blows air inside. The difference this time is that he bites down on his forearm and &lt;strong&gt;blows air into his muscles&lt;/strong&gt; instead of his bones. By having air inside his muscles he can control their expansion and contraction and can thus control his muscles by displacing the air inside of them. People's muscles aren't as strong as their bones though, so if a normal person or even a normal rubber man would blow such amounts of air inside his muscles, they will explode due to the massive amount of pressure. That's why Luffy can only use gear fourth when coated in &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Haki/Busoshoku_Haki" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Busoshoku Haki&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 He then uses his Haki coated body, to further increase his manipulation over his body. &lt;strong&gt;By changing the amounts of Haki he manipulates the elasticity of his rubber&lt;/strong&gt;. As a child you might have played around with rubber bands, and you might have noticed that the harder the elasticity, the harder the rebound will be. This is exactly what Luffy uses with his attacks. Before Gear Fourth, Luffy would throw his arm back to increase tensing, but now similar to Bellamy's &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Bane_Bane_no_Mi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Spring Fruit&lt;/a&gt;, he pushes his arm inside creating tensing, letting it hit the opponent much harder and faster.
&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBUSv.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBUSvm.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Having such great control over his Haki and his rubberiness, Gear Fourth has another advantage. &lt;strong&gt;Luffy can now bypass other people's Busoshoku Haki&lt;/strong&gt; as mentioned &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/11504/6166"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Luffy was hit by Doflamingo, yet Doflamingo's attack bounced right off. By &lt;em&gt;fusing&lt;/em&gt; Haki with rubber, he is now freely controlling the expansion and contraction of his rubber despite what the other person throws at him.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Gear fourth also comes with &lt;strong&gt;side affects&lt;/strong&gt;. The usage of such amounts of Haki comes at a price (as can be read &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/11164/6166"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, at the time of writing (chapter 787), there is a time limit to using Gear Fourth. Luffy can only use &lt;em&gt;Boundman&lt;/em&gt; for 20 minutes and after that he is rendered unable to use any Haki for 10 more minutes. Another problem with having inflated muscles is that they become bouncier and thus making Luffy incapable of just standing still on the ground. Although this might change in the future, similar to the other gears. Luffy has overcome his other side-effects so he might overcome these ones too.&lt;/p&gt;

It seemed familiar, but I didn't manage to recall the title of the show.

&lt;p&gt;the English version deleted much of the risqu&#233; humor that, while not uncommon in children's animation in Japan, would be considered unacceptable by American standards, with the policewoman Sachiko (Sgt. Sally) being the usual target of the fan service-oriented humor. The TV series also aired in its entirety in Italy under the title Robottino ("Little robot"), and some episodes are also available in Spanish as Robotete.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for Juvia to be a Water Dragon Slayer to be in Fairy Tail? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's honestly making me feel like it and it's now a theory I'm asking myself now if Juvia could be a Water Dragon Slayer?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43366">&lt;p&gt;No, she's not a water dragon slayer. Here is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She never "eats" her element to power up, she only drinks water like normal people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not from any generation of Dragon Slayers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a first generation Dragon Slayer. She has never learn her Magic from an actual Dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a second generation Dragon Slayer. She has never had Dragon Lacrima implanted into her body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a third generation Dragon Slayer. She has never both learn her Magic from an actual Dragon and had Dragon Lacrima implanted into her body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a fourth generation Dragon Slayer. Not an artificial beings created from Dragon Lacrima. (From the movie)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of her skill something like "Roaring Magic".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of her magic use the word "Dragon" unlike all Dragon Slayers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never has seen to have motion sickness like Natsu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never has seen to have dragon scales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When fighting Dragons, her magic didn't have any effect on them. (the only magic that can hurt dragon is Dragon Slayer magic).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like I said in the comment, the premises is to have 7 dragon slayers in FT side and they are Natsu, Gajeel, Wendy, Laxus, Cobra, Sting and Rogue. There's no chance of an 8th Dragon Slayer. &lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="634" Title="What's written in Ayatsuji Tsukasa's notebook?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about the notebook seen in the episode 21 of Amagami SS. She said it contained something that could make her leave the school (maybe being expelled?). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If it's that serious, could it be a crime? Did I miss an important plot detail that explains it? Do the contents even get explained in another adaptation of Amagami like the manga or the VN, or are they completely unknown?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="636">&lt;p&gt;There is no mention of the exact contents of the notebook in the original VN or the anime. There are a couple of short sequel games which I have not gone through, so in principle there could be some explanation there, but given how important this is I doubt they'd want to relegate it to a side-game. Hence, the authors have definitely and deliberately hidden what is in her notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some good theories. The most common viewpoint is that she was using the notebook as a diary to vent her frustration with everyone else, particularly her sister. Despite the fact that Tsukasa is harder-working, her sister always seems to be more popular. Of course, she has more to vent about than that, and it's pretty safe to guess that the diary contained all sorts of things about everyone. That's why, if it ever went public, she wouldn't be able to go to school any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.animesuki.com/showpost.php?p=3385022&amp;amp;postcount=39" rel="noreferrer"&gt;This forum post&lt;/a&gt; provides a pretty complete and fairly consistent picture of Ayatsuji from a psychological standpoint. The segment about her notebook is quoted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Birth and the Function of her Diary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We believe that [having someone/something to listen to her] was the function of her diary, which she so desperately guarded. Here, the Inner Tsukasa was writing down her life, her frustrations, and her thoughts which she couldn't share with anybody. In a way, it was her way to deal with whatever gave her a hard time. Some kind of offline-blog, talking to herself. It also explains why the contents would be damaging enough that she "couldn't come to school anymore" if they'd ever come out.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We could see in episode 3 how much she was annoyed at the laziness and pettiness of the three bitches. Her Facade would have never allowed to show her anger - instead, it rather demanded that she would go through a humiliating insincere teary apology, sacrificing her (absolutely justified) anger and pride for the sake of ultimate success. In the past, she probably would have made an entry in the diary - this time, she did it in person, with disastrous results.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This is how Junichi uncovered the "Inner" Tsukasa - when he picked up the diary. Tsukasa believed that he had actually read it, and that there was no need to maintain the Facade towards him anymore. It also proves that Ayatsuji has no split or bipolar personality: The Inner Tsukasa is always in control - she was able to drop the Facade in a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wit, Dio and Lucciola were friends as children growing up.  This continued until they reached maturity.  In fact, Dio holds Lucciola in such &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; regard that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Even after Dio is initially brainwashed by the guild (and Lucciola snaps him out of it by effectively sacrificing himself before Delphine), when he realizes that Lucciola is dead, he keeps the rear seat of his Vespa empty out of respect of the memory of his fallen comrade.  (Note that initially Dio demanded it stay empty because he was still a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; distraught behind the loss of his friend.  He somewhat mellows out in &lt;em&gt;Fam, the Silver Wing&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, make no mistake:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; male,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; romantically involved, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; close friends.&lt;/li&gt;

Is this because of the Haki he used for Red Hawk (which was not well drawn in the anime) or is there another reason?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="21770">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luffy would lose his power&lt;/strong&gt;, because Haki does not seem to negate the power of the sea at all. In chapter 603, we could see how Luffy put his hand into the ocean without coating it in Haki. He said to be powerless in the ocean, yet he was able to draw Sanji back to the boat. This would make it seem that due to his training during the time-skip, he has become able to withstand the power of the sea for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4xNN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in chapter 605, we could see how Luffy put his hand back into the ocean, but this time he coated it in Haki. Despite being fully coated, he still lost his power at the same rate. Luffy got a lot stronger during the time-skip and it might even be that, since he has more power to drain, it might take a bit longer, but &lt;strong&gt;it is safe to say that coating yourself in Haki does not negate the effects of the sea&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(I'm assuming the character is female from the voice actor who plays at that moment.) Moreover, if the character &lt;em&gt;weren't&lt;/em&gt; female, it would be odd for a school to allow him to wear braids.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1c8gw3/spoilers_aku_no_hana_episode_2_discussion/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; suggests that this character also appears in the manga, so is this just intentional character design, rather than an error in the art? If so, who is this character, and is there anything (e.g. personality traits) that might explain this odd hairstyle? (I have not read the manga yet, and so can't easily look this up.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I remembered seeing some video footage of the live-action filming that the rotoscoped animation was apparently from on YouTube, so I might try to dig that out to see if I can get a better idea of what's going on here. On a second glance the braids struck me as a bit odd in terms of the shaping of their ends (one usually expects the hair to thin out somewhat and possibly curve a bit), so it occurred to me that this might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; After reading the entire manga, I couldn't find a character with identical design. (From the uniform -- notice that the character here wears a bow, instead of a tie -- it seems certain that they're probably female.) However, I did notice a presumably female character with very short hair (for a girl) that was in the corresponding chapater of the manga. I don't remember if the character was wearing a female uniform but will look it up later when I have time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="22436">&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my comment, this doesn't seem to be an animation error. Aku No Hana is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;rotoscoped&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially drawing over live action sequences. Here's a shot from before it was animated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4LV43.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was intentional if they had this character dressed up like that. I haven't seen the animated show, but the character definitely doesn't appear in the manga, having read it myself also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a guess, but perhaps it was to exaggurate ugliness of a character because the animators couldn't do it that easily with the technique?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes it does seem to just be bizarre character design. Especially as the character barely appears in the anime and only has a single line.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="49953" Title="How come there are still Quincies if the whole race was wiped out?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I just don't get it. How can there be a quincy population if they were all wiped out?&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GKVg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GKVg.png&quot; alt=&quot;QUINCYARESUPPOSEDTOBEDEAD&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="49957">&lt;p&gt;because the entire race being wiped out was an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first off we know at the start of the series there were some Quincy still around such as as Uryu was being trained by his grand father Soken while Uryu's father was "retired" from being a Quincy so it's clear that they hadn't been all wiped out, more so we later learn that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Ichigo's mother Masaki is a Quincy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so the survivors from when they were "wiped out" was not limited to a single family&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the 1000 Year Blood War Arc we find out that hundreds of years before the Quincy was wiped out there was another conflict between the Quincy and the Soul Reapers in which the Quincy Progenitor, Yhwach, lost his powers after this battle and didn't resurrect for 990 years (900 years for his body to revive and 90 years to regain intellect) +9 more years for him regaining his former powers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;About 1,000 years ago, under unknown circumstances, Genry&#363;sai Shigekuni Yamamoto failed to kill him. Sometime around or during the course of this event, Yhwach witnessed the capabilities of Yamamoto's Bankai, Zanka no Tachi. After his battle with Yamamoto, Yhwach supposedly lost his powers. Quincy folklore spoke of him as "The Sealed King": after 900 years of being sealed, he would regain his pulse; after another 90, he would regain his intellect; and after 9 more years, he would absorb the power of every "impure" Quincy to make their abilities his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Yhwach#History" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Yhwach &gt; History (4th Paragraph)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after Yhwach's defeat the remainder of the Quincy who followed him went into hiding in the Seireitei and used the Reishi to create a invisible space where they hid waiting for Yhwach's return, these Quincy were called the Wandenreich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Wandenreich was hidden from the Soul Reaperd and keeping a low profile, they weren't apart of the group that threatened the balance almost 800 years later which lead the Soul Reapers to "wipe them out". so even if it was a full genocide by the Soul Reapers there was always going to be Quincy left in the Wandenreich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also Yhwach has the power to share his soul which is then used to cultivate the Quincy powers in that person before he takes back the the part of his soul he shared, so as long as Yhwach exists the Quincy can be reborn&lt;/p&gt;

Here goes nothing! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The series/ movie is about a little boy monkey (kind of like the monchichi monkeys) with brown fur. He is very rude and I remember that nobody likes him except for a little female monkey with white fur. Then there is this old wise monkey that puts a golden diadem on the head of the rude little monkey to teach him a lesson in humbleness and kindness. He is also put in some kind of (tree)cage. The female monkey keeps visiting him and keeps bringing him food, even when it starts to snow. He tells her to stay away, even though he kind of likes her, because he doesn't want her to go through all this trouble for him. At the end of the series/movie the little monkey is now more humble and nice to everybody and the golden diadem is removed from his head.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The picture above is how I picture the old wise monkey, but this picture could be from another series/movie. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also remember that there was another character. He was more human, like a tiny childlike demon-boy with a horn on his head. At one point he was riding a horse, but not on the back of the horse, but upside down on the belly of the horse. At the end of the series/movie, this character also became more &quot;good&quot;. I don't remember if there were human characters involved in the series/movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ok this sounds like a weird kind of shroomtrip, but this is all I can remember. I really hope that someone recognizes some of this stuff and can give me more information about it! Thanks a million in advance!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26851">&lt;p&gt;The character resembles Sun Wukong from Journey to the West story. I know there are several Chinese cartoons about it. This is only a speculation because not all of them fit with what you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. The picture in question&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That character resembles Sun Wukong from an old Chinese cartoon I watched in the early 80's. See the &lt;strong&gt;similarity in his face, hat and yellow cloth (not the red robe)&lt;/strong&gt; in the first picture. See also the &lt;strong&gt;golden diadem&lt;/strong&gt; in the second picture. The diadem is given by Goddess Guanyin so Sanzang can punish Wukong whenever Wukong disobeys him. There are 3 OVAs that I know, but the story is quite different from what you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first OVA is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_in_Heaven" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Havoc in Heaven (&#22823;&#38393;&#22825;&#23467;)&lt;/a&gt; which was released in 1961. It tells the origin of Sun Wukong and his rebellion against the Jade Emperor of Heaven. It ends when Sun Wukong destroy the Jade Emperor's palace and the Jade Emperor flees from the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second OVA is &lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%82%E6%9E%9C_(%E7%94%B5%E5%BD%B1)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ginseng Fruit (&#20154;&#21442;&#26524;)&lt;/a&gt; which was released in 1981. Wukong stole some fruit and angered the tree owner.

&lt;h1&gt;2. The horse scene&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last OVA is &lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%87%91%E7%8C%B4%E9%99%8D%E5%A6%96" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Monkey King Subdued the Evil (&#37329;&#29492;&#38477;&#22934;)&lt;/a&gt; which was released in 1985, there's a scene where &lt;strong&gt;a demoness disguised as a kid&lt;/strong&gt; tries to kidnap Wukong's master. &lt;strong&gt;The kid's hair style looks like horns&lt;/strong&gt;. The kid and Wukong's master ride a horse and &lt;strong&gt;Wukong grabs the horse from below&lt;/strong&gt;. See the pictures below. You can also watched &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBlTvl2U-rU" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the scene&lt;/a&gt; in Youtube. Skip into 24:45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. The female monkey and old monkey&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from the &lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A5%BF%E9%81%8A%E8%A8%98_(%E5%8B%95%E7%95%AB)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; which was released in 1998 by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of 52 episodes. Wukong saves a female monkey after he's born from the holy rock in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMRnUIsPMeQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;episode 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zzgdp.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zzgdp.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elder monkey tells a legend that whoever can complete the challenge will become the monkey king. Wukong completes the challenge and become the monkey king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tOVhZ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tOVhZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. The snow scene&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the challenge, Wukong wants to become a disciple of Master Puti. Master Puti didn't welcome him at first. So Wukong sit at the door for days. Even when it's raining and snowing, he still sits at the door. Finally Master Puti is moved by his dedication and teaches him 2 sacred arts, the Somersault Cloud and 72 Transformations. This scene is still in episode 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. Trapped&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After causing havoc in heaven, he was punished by the Buddha. He was imprisoned under a mountain and sealed by a paper talisman. Later Sanzang released him and made him his disciple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TNErj.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TNErj.png" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. Mismatch/contradiction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. The diadem is not given by the old monkey. I suspect there is another story after Sun Wukong finished his journey and was granted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Buddhahood&lt;/a&gt;. In your picture, he wears a Buddhist robe, does wear his golden diadem, sits in lotus position on a Padmasana (lotus throne) are what made me think of this. But this is just a speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. The female monkey is not a love interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. He's imprisoned under a mountain, not a cage nor a tree. The is no one who visits and gives him food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. The child demon with horn story doesn't match.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="26870">&lt;p&gt;The right movie/series was not in the answer, but thanks to your information I got a lead on the movie I was looking for!! I put some pictures of the movie below. One with the main character, one with the main character and the female monkey, and one with the little horned demon kid. Thank you so much for the lead!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie is called Alakazam the great, It is a 1960 Japanese musical anime film, based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West, and was one of the earliest anime films to be released in the United States.(wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alakazam is a young and brave monkey (a macaque) who has been encouraged by all the other monkeys to become their king. After attaining the throne, he becomes rude and dictatorial, and does not believe that human beings are greater than he is. Then he tricks/forces Merlin the magician to teach him magic (reluctantly on Merlin's part, who warns Alakazam that the powers he acquires now will bring him much unhappiness later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alakazam becomes so arrogant that he abuses his magic powers, and chooses to go up to Majutsu Land (the Heavens), to challenge King Amo. He is defeated by King Amo. For his punishment, he is sentenced to serve as the bodyguard of Prince Amat on a pilgrimage; in order to learn humility, mercy and to fight with wisdom. Ultimately, he learns his lesson and becomes a true hero.

</answer></question><question Id="47417" Title="How does All for One Impact Recoil quirk works?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Supposedly All for One Impact Recoil quirk &quot;enables All For One to completely reflect the impact of an attack back to the attacker&quot;. This seems to be the quirk used in season 3 episode 10 in the battle of All for One with All Might. If he can revert the impact of an attack back to the attacker, to use it all the time wouldn't turn the user invincible? Then why All for One doesnt use it all the time, does it have any flaws or drawbacks?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="47418">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to completely reflect the impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From where did you take this information? According to the &lt;a href="http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Impact_Recoil" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Boku no Hero Academia Wikia&lt;/a&gt; the physical impact gets reversed, but not "completely reflected". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it wouldn't turn the user invincible, because the user is still to some degree affected by the attack (as written in &lt;a href="http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Impact_Recoil" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Boku no Hero Academia Wikia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, this Quirk does not seem to cancel the impact completely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is probably why All For One uses Gran Torino as a shield instead of taking the punch himself.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen the original series of &lt;em&gt;Captain Harlock&lt;/em&gt;, however I recently watched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://myanimelist.net/anime/17269/Captain_Harlock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; during our most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2767/17758&quot;&gt;Weekend Anime Extra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I followed along with the plot pretty well, and understood where the story was the whole time... That is until we got to the last few minutes and everything I knew just went out the window. So, it seems everyone just came back to life and the legend of Captain Harlock is going to continue, but why? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically, I'm looking for an explanation of what happened at the end. Why did everyone come back to life? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="40626">&lt;p&gt;Basically, Harlock activates the detonators each time and he dies, and logan is replacing him. At this point if you didn't understood, logan is harlock. Although this time, he did not activate the detonators by seeing logan (his younger self) eager for life and merelly having the same dream harlock once had for earth and humanity. At this point, he's steping back in command allowing logan to lead arcadia and the crew. That's why you see 2 of them in the end, and that's why the crew revived and the dark matter came back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie gave you a big hint at the start by saying:
"Far, far in the future... Or perhaps, the distant past..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it solved the trouble you had with the ending.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41366">&lt;p&gt;At the end, after the Arcadia has crash-landed on earth, a fleet arrives and signals "This is the Solar Federation, ...".

</answer></question><question Id="20990" Title="Why did Animax Asia stop telecasting Naruto Shippuden in India?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Animax Asia suddenly stopped airing new episodes of Naruto Shippuden in India as of January 30th 2014. As I am a Naruto fan, I was upset to see it cancelled. What was the reason it stopped airing?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38907">&lt;p&gt;This answer is based on my opinion and backed up with a few facts. So I can't say I'm sure that this is the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it's Animax India and not Animax Asia. It's different from the Animax in different Asian countries but is probably similar to the Animax in Singapore and Pakistan. This is what I understand from the articles on Animax Asia and Animax India on Wikipedia. I believe it is the shows that air on the channel that make all this difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I believe that this must be a common practice on Animax India. I think so because InuYasha met the same fate. The sequel of the series, InuYasha the Final Act was completely aired a few times but I have never seen them air the series InuYasha completely (that is, from when I have been viewing the channel, probably November of 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, I guess you would know why was Animax delisted by DTH connections (excluding DEN, Siti Digital and the likes) in India. It was because Animax couldn't pay carriage fees. Why? The most probable reason is the low viewership. You say Naruto is 'world famous'. Yes, agreed. But how many people do you personally know who watch/like anime, let alone Naruto. Not more that 10, or at most 15, I guess? That's the point. In comparison to the size of the country, the number of viewers is insufficient, if not negligible. So, airing any anime here in India is not practical, or I would say, profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first point tells you that Animax India is a different entity, the second one tells you that Naruto is not the only case and the third one gives you the (most probable) reason why Animax India discontinued airing new episodes of Naruto Shippuden. To summarize, Animax will air new episodes of Naruto Shippuden if there are enough viewers, which is not the case. Sad, but true. Then again, it's my opinion backed up with some facts. So, I can't be that sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: You are lucky to be able to even watch those limited episodes on Animax. I don't even get Animax here on Dish TV.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rules of the Death Note&lt;/a&gt; (i can't remember exactly which rule) and said by Ryuk himself when he was explaining things to Light ealry in the series, the main difference between a Human using the Death Note and a Shinigami using the Death Note is that Humans don't gain the difference in lifespan when they take a life while Shinigami do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now considering all the people the Kiras took the life of, they all could have been potential targets for Shinigami to increase their life.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So i am wondering, what exactly happens to the lifespan that normally would collected by a Shinigami when a Human uses the Death Note?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="15079">&lt;p&gt;This is actually covered by the &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rules of the Death Note&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use: LIX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A human death caused by Death Note will indirectly lengthen some other
  human's original life even without a specific intention to lengthen a
  particular person's original life span in the human world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that this simply means that the person killed "prematurely" has extended other people's lives as they go about their lives differently than if the person was there, thus events leading to their deaths may change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other rules of the Death Note cover what you are looking for. Glancing at a few likely places in the manga and reading over the wiki, I cannot find anything specifically stating if anything happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Misa's death shortly after the series, we can assume that she gained no extra life span from her efforts. Even when she reduced her life span to a quarter by trading for the shinigami eyes twice, she should have still lived a long time if killing someone influenced her life since it would have been added afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we know that the shinigami owner of the death note does not gain the life span because they did not write the name themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I would say that the left-over time is wasted. Other people's lives will be influenced due to the rule above, but the "remaining" time is not distributed in any means.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="40970">&lt;p&gt;It depends. Rule XXXV explicitly says "the owner" and after Light still was the owner, they could not just hand it to anyone. Rule IX however does not specify that fact. Maybe IX was simplified and it has to be the owner, maybe XXXV is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next problem is that the person has to really try to write the names. Who knows what happens if one is to copy a name four times and has the wrong spelling. Maybe the tricked one die, maybe the tricker.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="42139">&lt;p&gt;In the anime, the task force did not know about this rule. They only knew what was written on the notebook's inside cover. The additional information that Light pried out of Ryuk or discovered through experimentation are known only to him, not the taskforce. He would not reveal to them the things he learned, for obvious reasons (he doesn't actually want to make them immune to the Death Note, and also doesn't want to make himself look suspicious). Since the taskforce members didn't use the Death Note to kill people, they would not have discovered this rule. L, who was the only one willing to experiment with the Death Note, died before he got the chance. (I don't remember if this was true for the manga, so not speaking for that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that the rule you are referring to (rule XXXV) gives a person definite immunity to the particular Death Note where their name was misspelled. They might still be vulnerable to all other Death Notes out there, it's really not that clear. &lt;/p&gt;

This is a screenshot from the &lt;em&gt;Akito the Exiled&lt;/em&gt; trailer:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgvX0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Revolution Year 228; EU - Europe United Alliance&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, first question: &lt;strong&gt;What does a.t.b. stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10;And, also: &lt;strong&gt;How can we convert between a.t.b. and R.Y.? Which Revolution Year would 2010 a.t.b. be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4815">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does a.t.b. stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stands for "Ascension Throne Britannia", named after the "date the first Celtic super-king, Eowyn, was elected by the united British tribes to battle Rome, becoming the first member of the modern Britannian imperial family."&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/World_History"&gt;{1}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 55 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"&gt;B.C.&lt;/a&gt; is equivalent to 1 a.t.b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we convert between a.t.b. and R.Y.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Revolution Year system (used by the EU in &lt;em&gt;Code Geass&lt;/em&gt;) is based on the French Revolution (start date) of 1789 A.D.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"&gt;{2}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/European_Union#Akito_Worldview_Columns"&gt;{3}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since 55 B.C. is 1 a.t.b., we can figure out the actual conversion formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;0 R.Y. = 1789 A.D. = 1845 a.t.b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a simple conversion between a.t.b. and R.Y., just some simple math:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;R.Y. = a.t.b. - 1845&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Revolution Year would 2010 a.t.b. be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the conversion above, a.t.b. 2010 is equivalent to R.Y 165.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6744">&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the second episode of Akito the Exiled, the following is said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Revolution Year 228. It has been seven years since the Empire of Britannia invaded Japan and renamed it Area 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the invasion of Japan happened in 2010 a.t.b, it can be deduced that the offset, at least in the time frame of the series, between a.t.b and R.T is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2010 + 7 - 228 = 1789
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it appears that R.Y. 0 would correspond to 1789 a.t.b.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="11213" Title="How do Logia powers work?" Body="&lt;p&gt;PS: Warning, not sure whether parts should be considered spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Logia typed Devil Fruit Users cannot be hit without Haki. Yet while re-watching the Alabasta Arc, Ace was touched twice by Luffy. The first time when he flew inside the restaurant, Luffy hit Smoker and threw him up against Ace, both making a huge hole in the next couple of buildings. The second time was when Luffy was arm wrestling Ace, although this scene might not be canon though. So my question is, how was Luffy able to push back both Smoker and Ace when flying inside the restaurant, since he shouldn't be able to. Does this mean Logia users can &quot;solidify&quot; themselves or maybe only parts of themselves, kind of like coating with Haki? Also what would be the default form for a Logia user?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="11214">&lt;p&gt;Logia users can transform themselves into their elements at their own will. I think when Logia users are casually doing their work or just sitting around they tend to be in their normal form and so they can be hit by normal attacks. But even if they are hit they can be shattered and dispersed but come back together. So the only way to really hurt them would be with Haki, Kairoseki, or under a special circumstance like Luffy's rubber disabling Enel's electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="13659">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is said that Logia typed Devil Fruit Users cannot be hit without Haki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luffy using water to hit Crocodile shows that Logia typed Devil Fruit's weakness can be used to hit without using Haki. So to harm a Logia is to exploit the element itself, using its properties to solidify the user and rendering them vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Logia#Weaknesses" rel="nofollow"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite the fearsome power of Logia users, they are far from truly being invincible. Sneak attacks are more likely to work, as the user will not be ready to avoid them. However, with training, most Logia users learn to transform by reflex, eliminating the ability to strike them by conventional means. For example, Enel's ability has been trained to the point that he could reflexively change form while partially asleep using Mantra to predict his enemy's actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Inexperienced Logia users also tend to become seemingly overconfident, as they are unaccustomed to physically dodging attacks or receiving attacks, due to their powers. Thus, if their advantage is neutralized by some means, they then have to rely on their physical ability to dodge, a skill which they may or may not be proficient at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very high skill and training required to dodge any sudden attack. Physical contact is required to hit Logia user, so a well trained user can avoid  Haki-imbued attacks by changing the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does this mean Logia users can "solidify" themselves or maybe only parts of themselves, kind of like coating with Haki?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes they can solidify and turn there part of body as they want. Crocodile hand turn into sand while he was holding Vivi. Aokiji using ice leg in One Piece Film: Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is clear that default form is human state and change according to requirement. And can be hit without using Haki.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14436">&lt;p&gt;Logia users have full control over which state they are in, and have been shown to be able to have parts of their body in different states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some activities where literally being fire is very impractical, such as when eating or drinking. Logia users spend the majority of their time in their human forms of flesh and blood, but many have trained to the point where when something or someone unexpectedly makes contact with them they reflexively turn the point of contact and surrounding area into their element. For more powerful users, this is augmented by Kenbonshoku haki. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But logia users are still just humans. When Luffy hit both Ace and Smoker by mistake, Ace was eating, and I think Smoker was caught off guard because he was concentrating on Ace as the only threat at the time. It's also worth mentioning that despite Smoker being very strong, he is one of the weaker logias shown thus far and at that time did not appear to posess haki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the default form for any human with a devil fruit is their original form, from what we have seen of all Logias and Zoans, with the exception of Chopper, but he throws up all kinds of exceptions, and is also not human.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14459">&lt;p&gt;Well topic a bit exhausted, but i will give one addiction, we dont really know much logia types, we know the 'strong' ones, but they all(?) can use observation haki, so they know when to use it (so they can't be killed in distraction). Maybe Ace and Smoker couldn't use it... We don't really know 'weak ones' to try understanding logia type (if they were unhittable, it would be overpowered)!&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="26687" Title="What would have happened if Brook Died from eating a Second Devil Fruit?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I saw a post about &quot;Creating your own Devil Fruit Powers&quot;.. Most OP would be having two abilities. Then I remember that eating Two Devil Fruits = your body to explode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So.. I was thinking, What would have been the Result if Brook (Alive) would have died by eating a second Devil Fruit? Would his Yomi Yomi no Mi powers activate and revive him and if so, he is a person that was able to eat two devil fruit and live which means, two abilities? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="30764">&lt;p&gt;I think it was established that the abilities of Yomi Yomi no Mi will activate only once. So Brook will die if he eats another DF and not come back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting the wikia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Yomi Yomi no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which enhances the user's soul to the point where they can come back to life &lt;strong&gt;after dying once&lt;/strong&gt;, remaining alive until their body is sufficiently damaged, and to use several other soul-based abilities, making the user a Reviving Human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="30778">&lt;p&gt;From my interpretation of your question I believe that according to what we know about what happens to people who eat two fruits. I will reference a few things as I go about answering your question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Revive-Revive Fruit that Brook possesses, also called the Yomi Yomi no Mi, is a Paramecia class that can bring the user back to life after death. But later in the series it is declared that the fruit has "further" capabilities and can enable several other things as referenced &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yomi_Yomi_no_Mi" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Brook uses these abilities in later episodes after the timeskip. As he found the "true nature of his fruit". Now whether or not that means he &lt;strong&gt;awakened his power&lt;/strong&gt; or not is still up to speculation at this point, but I suspect we will see more at the next arc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22090/what-will-happen-if-one-person-eats-two-devil-fruits"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9953/can-blackbeard-consume-more-than-one-devil-fruit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few special exceptions where a particular person can have more than one fruit, so it is &lt;strong&gt;theoretically&lt;/strong&gt; possible for Brook to have multiple fruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that most folks can't have more than one Devil Fruit and that Brook's power &lt;strong&gt;IS NOT&lt;/strong&gt; "used up", and referring &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5261/can-brook-have-another-devil-fruit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I will follow the fact from &lt;a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Mythbusters/Misunderstandings_and_Mistranslations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Myth: When you eat 2 Devil Fruits, the second fruit will replace the first fruit's power.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Eiichiro Oda stated in one of his SBS that you cannot transfer the fruit's power to another person, if you take one bite of it the fruit becomes normal. This caused fans to think he meant if you eat the second Devil Fruit it will replace the first fruit but in Enies Lobby Arc, Lucci and Blueno said if you eat the second fruit after eating the first one, your body will explode and you will die.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Fact: An exception to the rule stated above is Marshall D. Teach, user of the Yami Yami no Mi fruit, who stole the power of the Gura Gura no Mi fruit through some currently unknown means not related to eating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that if Brook ate a second fruit, his body would explode. Upon which the Revive Fruit which is there would try to activate returning his soul to his body, but due to no longer having a body via an explosion his soul would be trapped in the physical world but without a body to be in. Therefore he'd live but without a second ability, body or any method to do anything. He'd be a mass of floating "conscience". That is unless his fruit enables a possession technique of sorts which we have not seen yet. I hope I either answered your question or provided enough to read to help you arrive to a better one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt; Brook would die, revive and not have a body or a second power.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="40989">&lt;p&gt;It is a good thinking but it is not how the Yomi Yomi no Mi works. It can bring you soul back to the human world but the sould must find the body. Eating two DF makes you explode so there is nothing left to find. At least the skeleton has du be intact.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="9532" Title="Are all apparitions on Monogatari based on actual stories?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the Monogatari Series, there are a lot apparitions. The ones that can easily recognized as corresponding to actual stories in real life are the phoenix (Araragi Tsuhiki) and vampire (Araragi Koyomi, Oshino Shinobu). What about the others? Here's a list of apparition that appear so far in anime&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Crab God (Senjougahara Hitagi)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Lost Cow/Snail (Hachikuji Mayoi)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Monkey Paw/Rainy Devil (Kanbaru Suruga)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Snake God (Sengoku Nadeko)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Flame-Wreath Bee (Araragi Karen)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Black-Hanekawa (Hanekawa Tsubasa)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Hanekawa, they said that it's a new kind of apparition. Are all of them based on apparitions in &quot;real-life&quot; stories?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="9539">&lt;p&gt;While it's difficult to prove a negative, and there's no telling where Nisio Isin got his inspiration from, I would be willing to claim that that most of the apparitions appearing in the Monogatari series aren't quite based on real-life stories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, one point in favor of this position is that other people on the internet (in Japan) have also tried to find origins for the various apparitions and failed. Given the popularity of Monogatari, this strongly suggests that there indeed aren't any real-life bases for most of the apparitions, though, of course, this doesn't amount to conclusive proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Crab&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitagi's crab is a difficult case to handle. Crabs are a semi-frequent feature of Japanese folklore - see, for example, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crab_and_the_Monkey"&gt;the tale of the Crab and the Monkey&lt;/a&gt; (which Meme mentions), or the legends surrounding the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikegani"&gt;Heike crabs&lt;/a&gt;, so we can't discard out-of-hand the possibility that the "Weight Crab" (&lt;em&gt;omoshikani&lt;/em&gt;) has basis in actual legend. Nonetheless, it seems improbable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meme claims that legends of the "Weight Crab" originated from peoples living in the mountains of Kyushu. However, he goes on to point out that the areas from which these legends originated - the mountainous parts of Oita and Miyazaki - are not actually places where you will find any crabs. Meme brushes this off, explaining that it's easier to concoct grand legends about crabs when you don't have any actual crabs at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced that this really makes sense in a real-world context, though - do people tend to feature in their legends creatures that they have little contact with? I'm no anthropologist, but it seems unlikely. Someone familiar with the folklore of Kyushu would know more, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some things about Hitagi's crab that just seem too convenient. For example, its name is incredibly punnable in ways relevant to the plot - &#24605;&#12356; &lt;em&gt;omoi&lt;/em&gt; "thoughts" vs. &#24819;&#12356; &lt;em&gt;omoi&lt;/em&gt; "feelings" vs. &#37325;&#12356; &lt;em&gt;omoi&lt;/em&gt; "heavy". The resolution of this arc is strongly related to the realization that the crab took not both Hitagi's weight, but also her feelings from her. It would be a damn surprise if there was an existing legend out there that matched up with this. Far more likely is that Nisio Isin thought that this would be an amusing pun and invented a legend to go along with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The points I've made in this section also generally apply to Mayoi's Snail and Nadeko's Constrictor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Snail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it's difficult to make a strong claim that Mayoi's snail has no basis in actual legend. Snails are not prominent features in Japanese legend, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rainy Devil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Monkey's Paw" &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a basis in real-life - a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw"&gt;short story by W. W. Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; titled as such. And that's the problem - Kanbaru's apparition &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; a Monkey's Paw, but rather a Rainy Devil, which is an apparition possessing only superficial similarities to the Monkey's Paw of Jacobs's story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's pretty clear here that Nisio Isin was deliberately playing with the reader's expectations by having the characters themselves incorrectly identify the arm as a Monkey's Paw - and then they go to visit Meme, who pulls the rug out from under them, revealing that it was something else altogether. This strongly suggests that the Rainy Devil is a creation of Nisio Isin's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Constrictor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, it's very difficult to show that the Constrictor (&lt;em&gt;jagirinawa&lt;/em&gt;) has no basis in legend, since there's nothing terribly unique about it - it's a snake that possesses people. That's basically all there is to it. Snakes are certainly common features of legend throughout the world (as Meme points out), and I wouldn't be surprised if some group of people somewhere in the world did believe in a constrictor snake that possessed people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with the crab, though, this is most likely a case of the author taking a motif well-established in folklore and putting an original spin on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll update this answer later with more details. A few notes in the meanwhile: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hanekawa's cat is certainly an invention of the author, as you point out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shinobu explicitly identifies Tsukihi's phoenix (the &lt;em&gt;shidenodori&lt;/em&gt;) as having some unusual features that don't match up to the conventional conception of a phoenix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that Karen's bee is a fabrication even in the context of the story, I'd imagine legends of it don't exist out here in the real world either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for Monogatari Second Season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; --There are no tigers in Japan. And besides, Hanekawa's tiger (the &lt;em&gt;kako&lt;/em&gt;) is far too punnable to be real, just like Hitagi's crab.&lt;br&gt;
 --Jiangshi are a real thing, though Monogatari jiangshis appear to differ from real-life jiangshis in some minor ways.&lt;br&gt;
 --Nadeko's &lt;em&gt;kuchinawa&lt;/em&gt; might be inspired by snake legends, but it's pretty obviously original for the most part.&lt;br&gt;
 --The apparition-eating darkness of Onimonogatari only makes sense in the context of the Monogatari world. It wouldn't make sense for it to be based on a real legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="38142">&lt;p&gt;In a short awnser no they are not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nisio isin did take inspiration from some other works of literature but in reality the appereritions are not real. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actuality the apperitions that are haunting the girls are foils for their characters &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitagi gets a crab because she portrays a strong outershell that pushes others away yet hides a soft interior. Like many Tsunderes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayoi was a foil for araragi's sisters so she was a snail or a cow because in japan cows usually block roads when one is trying to get home slowing them down in the process, just like araragi didn't want to go home so he ended up meeting Mayoi. Also she is called a snail because the kanji for cow is also in the kanji for snail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suruga gets a monkey because in japanese and many eastern cultures monkeys are said to be full of jelousy which is why people portray the phrase "see no evil, do no evil, speak no evil and hear no evil" with a monkey as their representatives. That phrase contributed a lot to suruga's spirit. As she was jelous because she had heard that Hitagi was in a relationship, confronted araragi in her own way with puns and innuendos due to the author and destroyed araragi all because of her jealousy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sengoku gets a snake because she is portrayed as a victim character. She is wrapped in snakes to make her look moe which is the point to her character too. She is the only one to not be cursed trough her own doing in bakemono. She is given snakes so that she would be placed in bondage positions for the viewer and she kinda liked it also because as a victim she had to either act or be crushed like a mouse and so she did act making her develop further in otorimonogatari. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanekawa is tricky because she was given a cat due to her pure nature as a person and as a lustful one in her black hanekawa form. 
Also to get her other tiger form you should read the story "a beast under the moonlight" which is about a man that turns into a white tiger to reak havoc in japan and is the influence behind her spirit in Nekomonogatari white&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen's spirit isnt given much tought due to the orgin of Nisemonogatari. Nisio isin wrote this one as a fanficfion for himself. Nisemono means fake making the title fake story. So these stories both karen bee and Taukihi phoenix were not really given much thought like the others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And araragi being a vampire was just to give him a way to deconstuct the harem genre. Araragi is made imortal so that he can risk his life to help the girls and is tought by shinobu that because he wants to help that makes him hurt others without his intention. Just like how he went against black hanekawa and suruga without saying something to Hitagi. This is why shinobu is conected by pain to him. He is a deconstruction of the male lead and is given an actual representatios as how horrible going out of your way to help others can really be &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, the titans wandering around the walls seem to live longer than 13 years, bypassing the curse. We know for sure that the normal titans live longer because of the Smiling Titan.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why aren't the wandering titans affected by the curse? Shouldn't all the titans have died just because of this curse?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="42239">&lt;p&gt;The following answer contains spoilers from chapter 88 and after. &lt;em&gt;(For those who don't read the manga: it's WAY beyond the anime)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know from chapter 88 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;among the "subjects of Ymir" there are always up to 9 people who inherit the power of the titans, a piece of Ymir's "soul" or power, which allows them to transform into one of the nine "special" titans. Along with this power they inherit the curse of Ymir, which is the reason they die 13 years after awakening to their powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand the "normal" titans were originally &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"subjects of Ymir" who were transformed into titans by injecting titan spinal fluid into them. But they did not inherit the original titan power, so they didn't inherit the curse either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="48856">&lt;p&gt;Regarding the special titans,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; the 12 disciples of Ymir die in 13 years, so only the Shifters die in 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But normal titans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; were turned by force, so they would not have died 13 years because they did not inherit the titan shift unless they eat a titan shifter, which will start the 13-years timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for Eren's case,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; his 13-years timer started when he first turned into a titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the conclusion is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; when you eat the titan shifter, you have to wait until you turn into a titan to start the 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="6663" Title="What differences are there between the manga and anime version of Coppelion?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I've just watched Coppelion. Was curious about the manga, and according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppelion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;... it is still going on? Apparently it has nearly 200 chapters, so I guess that the anime doesn't cover a large portion of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if there will be further anime adaptations (will there?), but right now I'm more interested in knowing how does the current anime portion differ from its manga counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How faithful is the anime, so far?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="6728">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've just watched Coppelion. Was curious about the manga, and according to the Wikipedia page... it is still going on? Apparently it has nearly 200 chapters, so I guess that the anime doesn't cover a large portion of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coppelion manga is broken down into "arcs" (&#37096;). As of this writing, the manga is part-way through the fourth arc, while the anime finished up at the end of the second arc. So the anime covers roughly half-ish of the manga released so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How faithful is the anime, so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime was generally very faithful to the manga. There are minor differences in the order in which things are presented, and there's a flashback featuring Naruse and Haruto in Mission.40 which I don't think appears in the anime, and some of the stuff towards the end of the second arc are kind of rushed, but all things considered, there aren't really many differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to verify for yourself that the anime is highly faithful, see below for a table indicating which chapters corresponded to which episodes. Note that Coppelion has a strange chapter naming scheme, in which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first arc has 21 chapters, numbered "#1", ..., "#21", and not given names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second arc has 60 chapters, numbered "Mission.1", ..., "Mission.60", and given names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third arc has 99 chapters, numbered "Phase.1", ..., "Phase.99", and given names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth arc (in progress) has 12 chapters (as of volume 20), numbered "Act.1", ..., "Act.12", and given names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

So a large-scale attack that can obliterate a Menos might purify all of the souls.&lt;/p&gt;

But Nagato's both eyes have Rinnegan when they are transplanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How did Madara Uchiha give his Rinnegan to Nagato?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43735">&lt;p&gt;As far as I can remember, Madara awakened Rinnegan in both his eyes. He used Hashirama's cells to achieve the result, which affected both his eyes. The reason it seemed only his one eye had Rinnegan was because of his hairstyle which covered his other eye.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43741">&lt;p&gt;Eye transplants before his death. He choose an Uzumaki because he believed that they were able to wield it as well as an Uchiha. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43752">&lt;p&gt;Madara gave both his rinnegans to Nagato and when he was revived with Edo Tensei, the jutsu gave him some fake eyes to make him appear as he was before death (or when the sample for the jutsu was collected). So when he was actually revived and came back to life, He was revived the way he died( without his own eyes). Then he takes back only one of his rinnegans because the other one is being used by Tobi. He steals the eye back from Tobi later on to complete his state.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="43800">&lt;p&gt;Madara had activated Izanagi in his right eye. Using this forbidden jutsu, he came back to life after Hashirama killed him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because he used Izanagi, the light/sight of the right eye was removed. Because that's the price you have to pay when you use Izanagi or Izanami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madara had bit off a piece of Hashirama's flesh during the battle. After he came back alive, he went into hiding, planting a clone in his tomb. Then he surgically attached the flesh onto his body and waited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of his natural life, he awoke the Rinnegan in both eyes. This awakening restored the sight in his right eye, a unique property of the Rinnegan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he was nearing death and was unable to complete his plans, he transplanted his eyes to a Senju descendant, Nagato. The technique he used is not mentioned anywhere, but it would be a piece of cake for him, because of his intelligence and the help from Zetsu.&lt;/p&gt;

Their emotions should have been completely erased, and made into a strict killing machine, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="486">&lt;p&gt;I think they didn't fight at their full powers because Orochimaru controlled them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Other than Kabuto, who lets the ninjas fight themselves (more or less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because he really controls them, they can't fight better than Orochimaru allowed them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="487">&lt;p&gt;Revived or not, they're still not the real deal. The Third was not fighting against the real Shodai and Nidaime. That would have been perhaps a completely different fight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, the fact that Orochimaru's Edo Tensei might not have been that perfect and powerful (perhaps less perfect than Kabuto's), makes me (and not just me) think he used it for the sentimental effect it would have had on the Third, i.e. fighting against your predecessors, rather than actual relying on their (weakened) power only.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="2697">&lt;p&gt;In the later part of the manga, the Second Hokage (Nidaime) thanked Orochimaru for making his jutsu &lt;strong&gt;more perfect&lt;/strong&gt; because they were revived at their peak powers.&lt;br&gt;
During the first time, Orochimaru's Edo Tensei was not perfect, due to which Sarutobi was able to seal them inside the Shinigami's belly.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="2735">&lt;p&gt;I can think of two (2) theories about that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could've kept some "free will" to avoid using full force against a friendly, even though they were being controlled into. Perhaps their strength was enough to counter Orochimaru's control somewhat (but not enough to properly "release" themselves from his control). You see that, when summoned, one of the first things they did was "ask for forgiveness" from Sarutobi, because they had to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be linked to the "sacrificial bodies" Orochimaru used to summon them: By law of conservation, the "package" cannot be forced to contain something that goes beyond their capacity, and thus limited the strength of First and Second. It was not a hard limit (the ninjas used were &lt;em&gt;far inferior&lt;/em&gt;), but Orochimaru might be using THEIR full strength (but still be constraining First and Second's strength altogether).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspension of Disbelief aside, it might be the reason "why" they fought below their grade. That, or Sarutobi could manage both of them at once, but that's even more farfetched.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6078">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muriFb2rmeU" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muriFb2rmeU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite chakra needs to be put into context ... Like the first and second Hokage  had infinite chakra when they fought the third Hokage but still lost and the reason for that was simple .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an infinite amount of chakra does not mean  necessarily having an ability to raise your chakra levels indefinitely as in going from a particular energy capacity to raising it infinitely but like a battery which has a set power capacity being able to recharge or maintain that set power or chakra capacity to full indefinitely (my same argument on superman as he is  dependent on the suns power and since the suns output and life span including the amount of suns that exist are limited therefore his power to become stronger and stronger coincides with that limit like a rechargeable  battery with a limited recharger)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO AN EDO-TENSEI CHAKRA DOES NOT GO ABOVE ITS NATURAL LEVEL FROM WHEN THE PERSON WAS ALIVE (UNLESS CHAKRA CAPACITY WAS IMPROVED BY CASTER) BUT RATHER REGENERATES THE SAME WAY A DAMAGE BODY DOES WHICH MEANS BECOMING A ZOMBIE SIMPLY PUTS YOU INTO A CONSTANT STAGNANT STATE OF FIXED EXISTENCE SO IF YOU'RE A LEVEL 9 THEN YOU CONSTANTLY REGENERATE AND  RECUPERATE  BACK TO LEVEL 9 REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR OPPONENT DOES TO YOU OR HOW MUCH  CHAKRA YOU USE UP PER JUTSU .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER MADARA WAS  RESURRECTED AT FULL STRENGTH BECAUSE IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS AND IMPROVED TO BOOT AND EVEN IF HE WAS NOT , DOES HE HAVE JUTSUS WHICH REQUIRE GREATER CHAKRA CAPACITY LEVELS THAN HIS EDO BODY AND IS THAT REALLY BETTER THAN HAVING THE ABILITY TO RECHARGE HIS CHAKRA AND USE KAMIKAZE  MANEUVERS ?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I remember the first and second Hokage are only at 70% of their power in ZOMBIE form currently. while I do suspect it may be a good trade off for the second Hokage as his techniques seem to be based on talent for execution rather than power level, the first is like Gaara and Kisame in that their abilities become bigger and more powerful like a DBZ character by just using higher amounts of chakra  pumped into it although you would think they can just add more and more chakra to an already executed jutsu as time goes on but whatever .&#65279;&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="6632">&lt;p&gt;It's actually because the author (Kishimoto) did not plan out the entire story at that point. They used to describe the Third as the strongest Hokage, but this all changed when we got to Shippuuden. Don't bother trying to explain it within the Naruto universe - it's simply an inconsistency in the story, even if Kishimoto writes in some details to patch this error up later on. It's not a knock on the Naruto series though, as this show has been going on for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I know that Nagato used Yahiko's body to become 'Pain' but can anyone please tell me why and how he did it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44453">&lt;p&gt;Nagato had an ability called the &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Outer_Path" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Outer Path&lt;/a&gt; using which he could revive the dead, transmit chakra to receivers. Using this ability of his, he created his &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Six_Paths_of_Pain" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Six Paths of Pain&lt;/a&gt; technique. He used the technique to embed some chakra rods into certain corpses (including Yahiko's) and transmitted his chakra to the rods to control the bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why he did it, there are several reasons. Nagato got badly injured and damaged during his battle with Hanzo (the same one when Yahiko died). He was unable to move after that. Hanzo was still alive though. Nagato wanted to avenge Yahiko and he also wanted to continue their dream previous dream of peace (although his sense of peace got distorted). So Nagato still had to fight. That is why he created the Six Paths of Pain technique to allow himself to continue fighting and use his Rinnegan abilities. Secondly, he was very fond of Yahiko. He used Yahiko's body to form the strongest Deva Path. In terms of abilities, he was superior to the other paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what happened to Yahiko's body afterwards, well after Nagato died in the Hidden Leaf after the battle with Naruto, Konan retrieved the bodies of both Yahiko and Nagato and buried them in the Hidden Rain Village. And that is where Yahiko's body rests.&lt;/p&gt;

With his Mangekyo, he can teleport objects into a different dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Kakashi did this with Deidara's arm and his explosion, but released it somewhere else because of chakra-usage. Tobi seems to have the ability to keep objects in other dimensions as long as he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="1945">&lt;p&gt;It's explained in more detail in the manga. Anime viewers wouldn't know exactly what Tobi's power is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That location is an alternate dimension, unique to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Actually, since Tobi has the same eye as Kakashi, their dimension is shared. Tobi can freely insert and extract objects to/from his dimension. Kakashi can apparently insert things from a distance, and extract them directly from his eye.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Kakshi's counter attack happened because Tobi used his Kamui to teleport a part of him (that was going to get hit in the 'real' world), to the alternate dimension. Kakshi was waiting in that alternate dimension and hit him from there (in the stomach, causing him to spew blood). Kakshi later returned to the real world with his own Kamui.&lt;/p&gt;

One night, he witnesses a man killing someone with sword. Upon closer inspection, it is revealed that the facial expression of the slain man has a calm feeling to it. The character deduces that the killing must have been so swift that the slain man had no time to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Years after the man has been practicing his sword techniques, he encounters the man whom he has admired since that night. The character succeeds in decapitating the killer almost effortlessly.

The man regrets his life.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of something along lines of &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champaloo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rurouni Kenshin&lt;/em&gt;. However, there was no mentions on the characters lists for those descriptions. It could be an entirely different show.

&lt;p&gt;In that episode, Kenshin, the protagonist, encountered an old man who told him the exact story that you laid out in your post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man was already a hobbyist in swordsmanship, and participated in competitions with a wooden sword.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He saw a robber who killed some people with a technique as "fast as lightning, never eve realizing that it was over for them"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He killed a person, and left his love interest behind because she disapproved of the killing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He killed more people, and eventually cut down the robber with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

Rem could see everyone's name with her shinigami eyes, but would not kill anyone unless Misa was in trouble. So, Light put Misa in trouble and pressured Rem into killing L and Wastabi. As a result, Rem died and Light thought he had no more people in his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Rem didn't kill L and Wastabi, Misa definitely would have been caught again and killed. There would have been a lot of suspicion towards Light, but he may have been able to talk himself out of it. If he did not, he would have died also. It was a gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="7556">&lt;p&gt;Misa Misa  was a useful tool but, with Rem always wanting to protect her and began to really care for her Light couldn't use her in anyway that would put her endanger for Rem would kill him the first chance she got. In order to use Misa and kill L he got Misa taken in and "endanger" putting the blame on L that he had done it. Doing that and edging Rem to kill him in order to save Misa since she was the only creature that could see L's real name doing this was killing to birds with one stone that kept getting in the way of Light's "good work." &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Wild Tauros appears.&lt;br&gt;&#10;Trainer A throws Safari Ball (Ball A).&lt;br&gt;&#10;Trainer B throws a Safari Ball (Ball B).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, a rare occurrence happens: both PokeBalls hit Tauros at exactly the same time. What will happen to Tauros? Will it enter Ball A, Ball B, or neither? Since PokeBalls converts Pokemon into energy before storing it, will it split in two and each trainer will have half a Tauros in each ball? Will this kill Tauros in the process? What if one of the balls is of better quality or strength? Like a normal PokeBall vs. a Great Ball?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="35859">&lt;p&gt;Updated answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pok&#233;mon: Let's Go, Eevee&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pok&#233;mon: Let's Go, Pikachu&lt;/i&gt; introduce support trainers, a second player who aids the first player in battling other trainers and in capturing Pok&#233;mon. When the two trainers throw Pok&#233; Balls and hit a Pok&#233;mon at the same time, the Pok&#233; Balls combine and there is a greater chance the Pok&#233;mon will be caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculative answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Pok&#233;mon Adventures: Gold and Silver&lt;/i&gt;, Kurt explained that Pok&#233; Balls work by using a "capture net", which is very similar to a real net. In fact, in the manga, the gym leader Bugsy does use a real net with his Pok&#233; Balls. So in the hypothetical case where two Pok&#233; Balls hit one Pok&#233;mon, the result would be similar to two nets being used. The nets would interfere with each other and neither one would fully encapsulate Taurus. Taurus possibly would be immobilized for a short time before it broke free from both nets. In the anime it would glow red and become energy for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Bulbapedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the manga, Bugsy refers to his "capture net" as being the net that is supposedly inside a Pok&#233; Ball, but visible and already deployed. According to Kurt, this invisible net captures and physically stores a Pok&#233;mon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for better Pok&#233; Balls, such as a Great Ball, I would suspect their nets would be bigger and stronger, so they would be able to envelop the other Pok&#233; Ball's net and cancel it out. Thus, Taurus would be captured by the Great Ball.&lt;/p&gt;

If there's none, then I guess Naruto is actually a smart ninja. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="4023">&lt;p&gt;Well, here are some of the jutsu Naruto probably can't (or will be near impossible) to learn without Kurama:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques from elements other than Wind - Naruto's natural chakra affinity is towards wind, while he can train in other elements, he probably won't be able to learn some of the other elements. (Actually has nothing to do with the Bijuu, that's kinda what happens to everyone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bijuu Dama - a Bijuu specific technique (the nuclear-warhead like black sphere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible that using Kurama's Yang element chakra (sealed within Naruto), he'll be able to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tajuu Kage Bunshin - Even though Naruto naturally has massive chakra reserves, he wouldn't be able to make as much copies without the Kyuubi Chakra Pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</answer><answer Id="19096">&lt;p&gt;most of naruto jutsu really on bijuu.
even the rasenshuriken (his only futon jutsu), without kyuubi heal ability, naruto arm would be disabled to cell level after the first try.
If naruto hadn't kyuubi power (strong seal, fully isolate kyuubi from naruto like a high secured living storage scroll) naruto would be a outcast nobody (his strong own chakra level come from the seal convert and mix kyuubi chakra with his own)&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="39351">&lt;p&gt;Naruto was able to do multiple shadow clones (thousands of shadow clones) WITHOUT KURAMA or any other natural energy source. This is when he stopped taking karuma's help (Ep 52) and started learning rasenshuriken on his own. I guess most of the guys are getting it wrong here. I understand that kyuubi is the main reason behind his healing but you can't forget the uzumaki clan healing abilities and the level of chakra they possess. Naruto was able to maintain clones without kurama chakra and yamato was there to stop going kurama mode when naruto's chakra is completely depleted. I guess without kurama, Naruto can always learn different jutsus using multiple shadow clones with his OWN massive chakra level (20 years of training in just a week).

This is not a flashback but is actually the power of the wish turning time back to when he asks Chiemi out before the ousama game happened. 
Nobuaki is the real ousama but he does not realize as he time has reversed and therefore everything that unfolds is as a result of the power of suggestion from Nobuaki. He simply thinks it and it happens.
The dream right at the start is his vague memory of the events that occur&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="36871">&lt;p&gt;Chiemi's twin sister Natsuko is the real ousama, but Nobuaki does not realize it since he wished for the Ousama Game to never come about, because of this Chiemi was forced to switch places with her twin (in the new dimension his wish created) and thanks to that Natsuko wasn't angry at her father for abandoning her and her curse never comes about and thus remains dormant within her system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since in Ousama Game-Kigen it is implied that strong negative emotions are what trigger the virus to emerge, remember the scene (with the original Natsuko)  where she was in the shed crying because her mother and the village were tormenting her due to the fact that she was in love with her own cousin? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That HUGE AMOUNT OF STRESS is what caused her immune system to weaken enough for the virus to enter her.&lt;/p&gt;

Is there a way to permanently 'kill' Alucard?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="465">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hellsing.wikia.com/wiki/Alucard#Powers_and_abilities"&gt;This wiki &lt;/a&gt;has the following note about Alucard's immortality (may contain some spoilers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Immortality: This ability is rather ambiguous, as Alucard, himself has stated that immortality is a myth. However, what it most likely refers to is the human souls inside Alucard; it has been speculated that, when damaged by blow that would have killed or incapacitated him such as exceedingly holy weapons, the damage is instead directed to his reservoir of souls. Because this ability does not really grant him true immortality, it can be considered as pseudo-immortality. However, after "Monster of God" Anderson destroyed the rest of Level 0, Alucard was still able to regenerate on par with him. (This was on par with Alucard before releasing Level 0).  However, the "soul count" theory is just a fan theory, and has never been definitively proven. It was also specualted by Anderson that this was the reason for him not being able to kill Alucard. Alucard may have kept at least a few souls in his body to use for regeneration after releasing level 0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there is no official answer to this, I would describe ALucard, as the wikipedia page does: Alucard is the closest thing to immortal. This is a perfect description that suits him well, until it is revealed is he really immortal, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5301">&lt;p&gt;While people believe that Alucard is immortal, he says that he isn't, and we are later shown that this is because the only reason he is back from the dead is because he uses the enormous supply of souls he has absorbed throughout his unlife. However, at the end, &lt;a href="http://hellsing.wikia.com/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger#History" rel="nofollow"&gt;he may have gained the ability to revive freely thanks to Schrodinger's powers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By saying that he is not immortal, he may have meant that a being that is immortal doesn't mean it would be capable of handling such a fate and would wish to be killed. This side is greatly shown in the series where even Alucard himself wishes to be killed though by a person he sees as worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the current information, the only time Alucard was said to be mortal was when he released every soul inside him as an army, which made it impossible for him to use them to revive himself. However, this happened before he gained Schrodinger's powers. So unless more information is shown, the best guess is that Alucard can revive without limit now (like how Schrodinger did when he was shot 2 times but didn't die and reappeared fully healed, only to die when he willingly sacrificed himself in an effort to kill Alucard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know more please check the wiki. I am assuming all of this based on the information given and my own ideas. However, I believe this is the best description of Alucard's immortality as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5861">&lt;p&gt;After the final episode, when Alucard returns after consuming Schrodinger and killing every other soul in his consciousness, he is, as described by Schrodinger, everywhere and nowhere, both alive and dead but at the same time neither. He can exist wherever he wishes, and thus theoretically speaking, he could exist inter-dimensionally, as well physically and consciously, implying that no, he cannot ever be killed. He will exist forever.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="14865">&lt;p&gt;Alucard sounds semi-immortal, unlike true immortals, who will never ever die, Alucard can indeed die, so long as he wishes it, or if he is killed by some kind of immortal slaying weapon (for example, supernatural weapons specifically designed to kill semi-immortal beings). The best way to defeat an immortal is by sealing them, basically separating them from the physical world, either by magic, or by placing in a burial chamber which they cannot escape from. However, while Alucard, an omnipresence being, can be sealed, it would require extensive planning.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="17209">&lt;p&gt;Based on my knowledge of watching Hellsing Ultimate remember so many people try to kill him like Luke Valentine, polices, Walter and many other but the only one exceeded was the Major. Anyways he returned 30 years later. Just because Alucard is immortal doesn't mean these no way to kill him and he said " Only a human can kill me." I believe the only person can kill Alucard is his own master Sir Integra, this is my opinion but everyone has different opinions about is there ways to kill Alucard. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="19927">&lt;p&gt;Except he already lost his identity when he first consumed schrodinger? He wasn't aware that he existed yet he still came back. Which leads me to believe Alucard is definitely immortal as long as he wishes to be. He can not be killed. On the higher being part when Anderson absorbed the helena nail that's almost like the power of God yet he won still. This leads me to believe Alucard is immortal. &lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In the first episode of &lt;em&gt;Revolutionary Girl Utena&lt;/em&gt;, a teacher says &quot;You won't make a fool of me again this semester&quot;, which indicates that Utena is not new to the school.  I'm rewatching the show, and my memories of the show assumed she was a transfer student. This made me wonder why she didn't get involved in the mechanizations of the student council sooner. She received the signet ring when she was young, and had been going to that school already.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was there something special about that semester that triggered Utena's interest in the Rose Bride and the duels?  Is there any information on what happened with regards to the council prior to the start of the show?  Was this the first time Saionji won the duel, and the other council members aren't so abusive towards the Rose Bride, so they didn't attract Utena's attention?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7104">&lt;p&gt;As Gorchestopher H has said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;here is also an element of coming-of-age. She becomes involved because her time has come&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is correct as being one of the reason however,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Utena becomes involved because of the way the Rose Bride was being treated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is half-true. Yes Utena protects Anthy but this is because of Utena's role as the "prince" that protects the "princess" Anthy. However remember that it was not Utena that stopped Saionji in the beginning but Touga. Utena however confronts Saionji after his posts up Wakaba's love confession letter to him on the notice board for everyone to see and ridicule. Utena realizes it's Wakaba's letter when she sees her reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing this Utena challenges Saionji but because earlier in the day the Student Council was told by "End of the World" that a new Duelist would be arriving, he assumes she's the new Duelist and moves their duel to the arena. It is in their second duel Utena protect Anthy from being engaged to Saionji and being abused again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for why Utena didn't get involved in a previous semester, we can pinpoint everything to Utena getting involved originated in her seeing Anthy. Why Utena only noticed her in this semester seems to relate to Anthy's omnipresence. In the Apocalypse Saga when Micky is talking to his father, his father passes the phone to the woman who will be Mickey's step mother which we hear Anthy speaking and see her Rose Bride Dress, yet Micky does not pick up on this. Also Mikage is tricked into thinking Mamiya is alive and by his side but not only is his appearance completely different but he is dead and it was in fact Anthy. So it's quite possible that along with being omnipresent Anthy can also make it so people do not notice her.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Majin Buu has a beam where he can turn people into chocolate or assortments of candy. In one episode he turns an old man into a &lt;em&gt;carton&lt;/em&gt; of milk.

&lt;p&gt;I mistook monkey for money. Since gun and money are lifeless stuff, I would say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. People turned into lifeless stuff may still be conscious depending on how strong they are, for example, the fusion of Goku and Vegeta was turned into a candy yet still can fight, and Uub was turned into a chocolate by his own beam yet still can turn himself back.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8713">&lt;p&gt;It seems at first that the technique is simply a magic trick with no limit or explanation. But I think it's much deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is ki?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ki is the raw essence of energy in a body, and when a body has exactly no ki left, the body dies and the soul, essence, mind, whatever you want to call it, is sent to otherworld. All attacks require ki, heck even raising your arm requires a slight amount of ki. "Ki attacks" are attacks in which damage is not physical, but energy is shot from the body at an opponent or obstacle. Majin Buu's "magic transform beam" is no more mystical than any other attack, it's what he does with this ki that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ki control outside the body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goku showed in many, many instances that he can control a ki attack long after it has left his body, and this is what Majin Buu does in this attack. Instead of the Kamehameha or other ki attack which is designed to deal a powerful impact, Majin Buu is clever enough to attack the opponent's ki directly, and ultimately drain their body of all ki, rendering them lifeless. He can at this point shape the remaining matter however he wants, but I don't believe it has any flavor, just an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to defend against Buu's attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Buu uses this attack on common humans, he only needs to use a small amount of ki to wipe them out. For a whole crowd of people, I don't suspect that Buu even feels the energy usage. However, when he does this against a more powerful opponent, he must put more ki into the attack than the fighter has in total. This is still no real problem for Buu, as nobody can contest his ki... until Vegito comes to "PLAY, PLAY, PLAAAY!". Vegito's unimaginable ki was strong enough so that when Buu used his attack, it only drained a significant amount of ki from Vegito, leaving him very much alive if only a bit...compromised. He has enough energy leftover, plus Goku's ability to work around any disadvantage, to put up a strong fight even as a piece of candy, forcing Buu to reverse the effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How'd he do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Buu clearly underestimated Vegito and didn't put even half of his energy into that attack. Maybe with full power he could have succeeded in leaving both Goku and Vegeta lifeless and edible. But my question is, did he have to use the same amount of energy to revert Vegito to human, or did he get the original energy back, like performing the technique backwards? I don't fully understand this, and if he actually gave energy to Vegito, I don't get why he would do that as a response to getting his ass whooped by candy. This is a hole in my logic, and I can't defend it. This is just my best theory. Hope it inspired creative analysis, and hail Son-Goku.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="41384" Title="Why does Naruto's clothes not burn after wearing the Kyuubi cloak?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was watching Naruto Shippuden, episodes 35 to 45, and it is said many times that Naruto's skin burns when under Kyuubi's chakra effects. In those episodes, we see Naruto's skin is ripped off by Kyuubi's cloak when transforming into fourth tails. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why does Naruto still have clothes after Yamato reverts the 4 tailed state? If Kyuubi's chakra destroys what is under the cloak, shouldn't Naruto be naked after Yamato's jutsu?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="41393">&lt;p&gt;What you're describing are side effects to what's actually happening; exposing oneself to a bijuu's unfiltered chakra doesn't come at a cheap cost to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jinchuriki forms vary, but in essence, &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Jinch%C5%ABriki_Forms#Version_2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the host is regarded more as an endoskeleton&lt;/a&gt; when transforming beyond Version 2 into partial and full tailed beast mode.  A shroud of chakra surrounds the jinchuriki which is in the shape of (or is part of the shape of) the tailed beast within.  From that, it stands to reason that their host is underneath the layers of chakra, quite well-clothed.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="41394">&lt;p&gt;This my understanding on the matter.&lt;br&gt;
Kyuubi's chakra destroys any thing in touch with it if they have chakra. Since the clothing is not a living thing and is not receiving any chakra from any where and does not have a chakra flow in it, it will stand unharmed. But the skin has chakra points and a flow of chakra, so Kyuubi's chakra cloak will connect with it and because the skin is not strong enough to handle and channel Kyuubi's unfiltered chakra, it will burn away.&lt;/p&gt;

Or am I overthinking this and is the explanation just &quot;ZUN did it because it looks cool&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53743">&lt;p&gt;First, it should be noted that &lt;a href="https://aichiu.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=pages_view_main&amp;amp;active_action=repository_view_main_item_detail&amp;amp;item_id=4197&amp;amp;item_no=1&amp;amp;page_id=13&amp;amp;block_id=17" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;the japanese do incorporate English text into their media frequently&lt;/a&gt;. However, I am assuming why Touhou seems to make use of it especially is the matter of consideration here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However to be more Touhou specific, something that needs to be noted about Touhou in particular is that the theming of Touhou was, at least at some point, supposed to be an east meets west kind of thing. The Wikipedia page for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Shanghai_Alice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Team Shanghai Alice&lt;/a&gt;, which is licensed under &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CC-BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt; terms, notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The name "Team Shanghai Alice" was chosen to fit the overall theme of the Touhou games. "Shanghai", in ZUN's mind, is a multicultural city where the East and the West meet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are many examples of western cultural influence in the series. Marisa is very much a western style witch, Alice Margatroid is supposed to be the same Alice from &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;, and one of her theme songs is doll maker of bucuresti, where bucuresti is an alternative name for Burachest in Romania. He makes references to the moon landing when the Lunarians are involved: Imperishable Night has a song entitled Voyage 1969, and Clownpiece's costume very much resembles an american flag. Japan has no native folklore regarding vampires as we know them, like Remilia or Kurumi. Recently, in Forbidden Scrollery there was even a chupecabra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else that needs to be noted is that Touhou means &lt;em&gt;Eastern&lt;/em&gt; and Amusement Makers also made some &lt;a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Seihou_Project" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Seihou project&lt;/a&gt; games, where Seihou means Western. The Windows era designs of Marisa and Reimu are first shown in the Seihou games, where the characters made cameo appearances as extra stage bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the music rooms for the games, Zun sometimes comments on how certain songs seem distinctly Japanese to him, and &lt;a href="https://touhou.fandom.com/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story/Music" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;in Lotus Land Story's music rooms&lt;/a&gt; he comments about how he was trying to make the pieces feel western. &lt;a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Imperishable_Night/Music" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;In the Music Room description of Song of the Night Sparrow for Imperishable night&lt;/a&gt;, Zun comments that it was supposed to be a blend of eastern and western styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the closest I can personally find to Zun himself explaining it at present moment comes to commenting on this is in &lt;a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil/Music" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Afterword Correspondence Vol. 1 for Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil&lt;/a&gt;, where he acknowledges that his music used to follow the format, but any reason why is omitted from that observation. However, in consideration of these facts, I think it is reasonable to assume it was done to give the games a somewhat western feeling to them by blending eastern and western languages, to match the original theme.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="53748">&lt;p&gt;Zun haven't explicitly mention this but it is obvious that the titles should contain japanese characters since the actual development of the touhou project was based on the premise that there were few games based on japanese folklore at the time (I was looking for  the interview where he said this but couldn't find it). The left kanjis are more like "titles" remember that kanji convey a more wide range of meaning than actual words and then romaji in the right due to the nature of being a videogame in a computer also even the japanese themselves sometimes can't memorize all the kanjis, so we got the first ones &lt;code&gt;&#26481;&#26041;&lt;/code&gt; telling you 'eastern history' then followed by the title such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#32005;&#39764;&#37111; koumakan&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&#22934;&#12293;&#22818; youyoumu&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&#22320;&#38666;&#27583; chireiden&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;code&gt;&#26143;&#34030;&#33337; seiresen&lt;/code&gt; and so on, having a kanji title can give you the whole picture of what the game is gonna be about let's do ten desires for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#26481;&#26041; eastern history &#31070; god &#38666;&#24287; mausoleum&lt;/code&gt; so you would get something like &lt;em&gt;eastern history of the mausoleum spirit/god - ten desires&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be just a format without any special purpose but either way I think this looks really cool and truly feels &lt;em&gt;eastern&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are spelled same and pronounced in the same way! Is there a relation mentioned?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="28079">&lt;p&gt;The former owner of Quindecim was 'Quin'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/leKJA.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/leKJA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was then replaced by 'Decim'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFsLb.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFsLb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it's definitely not a coincidence that the name of the bar is Quindecim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Quindecim" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Wikia article on Quindecim&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is likely the arbiters Quin and Decim were named so for working on the fifteenth floor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence of this. One thing is for sure though, Quindecim wasn't named after the arbiters since Quindecim means 15 in Latin and that's the name of the floor the bar is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it's very likely that Quin and Decim were both named after the bar. However, nothing was ever stated in the anime or the movie 'Death Billiards', so we can never truly know.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="30347" Title="Why is the Fairy Tail post-hiatus OST so different from the pre-hiatus OST?" Body="&lt;p&gt;This may be just based in my own hearing abilities, but I think that many will agree that the post-hiatus Fairy Tail OST is quite different from the pre-hiatus OST.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of the pre-hiatus music were variations of the original theme song, and there would always be some kind of reincarnation of that theme pre-hiatus no matter how far the music started to stray from the original theme song.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the post-hiatus music seems much different, despite the music being composed by the same person pre and post-hiatus. It never brought back the old theme, and briefly revisited one of the sad songs from the pre-hiatus series.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there any reason for such a drastic change in music, besides of course, time? It seems as if the composer Yasuharu Takanashi is trying to stray away from the old Fairy Tail style of music altogether in the post-hiatus series, which I think is quite strange, since I think that many will attribute some of the pre-hiatus serie's success to be largely due to the music being very aptly chosen and composed very well to emotionally connect the viewer to the show.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"/><question Id="13261" Title="What are the familial relationships in Gentlemen's Alliance Cross?"

</answer></question><question Id="50476" Title="Is Mihawk stronger than one of the gorosei who holds the sword(since mihawk is titled strongest swordsman)?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Since mihawk is titled as the strongest swordsman and there is one samurai in the 5 elders team,so does that mean mihawk is stronger than that gorosei?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="50481">&lt;p&gt;We don't know because we don't know how strong that Gorosei is or (really) how strong Mihawk is.  Mihawk is likely a better swordsman than anyone in One Piece but that doesn't not mean he is stronger than that Gorosei in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several things to note: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mihawk being the strongest swordsman is as much of a title as a
display of his ability. If there is a character who is a stronger
swordsman, it must be that his ability is underestimated or not known
to the world at large. Zoro won't be the strongest swordsman until
he can somehow be demonstrated as earning that mantel.  As it is Mihawk's
defining character trait and Zoro's dream, I doubt Oda has some mystery swordsman somewhere who is stronger with a sword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mihawk's title only refers to his ability with a sword. It is notable that Mihawk's only power seems to come from his reputation
and swordmanship. He has no known devil fruit, no shown Haki (though
he obviously has Armament), no gimmicks, and no crew.  I don't think
many people would doubt that Shanks is stronger and Shanks uses a
sword.  Shank's power, however, includes his crew and his insane
levels of Conquerors Haki.  If Gorosei must be a stronger fighter, he might
be stronger for other reasons than swordsmanship. That being said:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reason to assume the Gorosei members must be all that strong. Maybe he was the strongest but got old. Maybe he was
never that strong but got there based on his intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also Whitebeard was the strongest man but Kaido is the strongest beast.  Maybe there is a stronger swordswoman somewhere? But that doesn't apply here... probably. Unless that Gorosei is a Celestial so is not to be downplayed to the level of mere "man"."&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="26215" Title="Are you considered a &quot;weaboo&quot; if you watch too much anime?" Body="&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think that watching anime is weaboo-ish.  So is that a general perception, or is that perception incorrect?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26219">&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this in more detail on my blog - &lt;a href="http://weeab.eu/am-i-a-weeaboo-an-otaku-a-handy-self-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Am I a Weeaboo"&gt;Weeab.eu&lt;/a&gt;, here's a summary version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weeaboo is generally an insulting term, a weeaboo is someone who love anime &lt;strong&gt;and annoys others with their enjoyment&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally things like yelling as if you're powering up, screaming when you see your anime-fan friends, etc. You can probably understand why people don't appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As insulting terms go, it's pretty standard in that those who usually use it, don't know much about the medium - Just like how you might be labelled as as a &lt;em&gt;goth&lt;/em&gt; if you just like shirts with skulls on them, or as a nerd if you like Star Wars - subcultures have a lot more to them than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to be technical, it literally means nothing - The original term was supposedly coined from the comic from the Perry Fellowship, with no context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Ao47.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Ao47.jpg" alt="enter image description here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; that term just as much as &lt;em&gt;geeks&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nerds&lt;/em&gt; can own their labels and make it a positive thing. Just like I've done by taking that blog name :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people like labels, some don't - do whatever you prefer. If you enjoy something, don't let others tell you not to enjoy it! :)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; The first LRIGs, Tama and Iona (then known as Shiro and Kuro) were created by Mayu to begin the LRIG and Selector system.

  &lt;p&gt; Mayu created two imaginary friends, Shiro and Kuro, in order to play the game with them, then proceeded to conjure up the idea of the Selector Games in her mind strictly for her own amusement, creating yet more imaginary friends which served as the first Selectors and LRIGs. Eventually, Mayu's make-belief games became so realistic that the imaginary friends took a life of their own. Mayu proceeded to send them out to WIXOSS players in the outside world, effectively "infecting" the game with her own, selfish desires. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="33576" Title="Are Eileen and Erza related?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the chapter 482, Neinhart started to realize that he has heard the name Erza before, nonetheless, he knows that she is the Erza Scarlet that he has heard of. He started figuring out that there might be some connection between Lady Eileen and Erza scarlet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hair&#8230;and this magic power&#8230;&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Grvw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Grvw.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;SO I want to ask are those two really related?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="33577">&lt;p&gt;The anime/manga itself hasn't confirmed it, so technically they currently are not related and the idea of them being related is a theory (doesn't mean its wrong). If the anime/manga DOES confirm it, then yes, they are related.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="33585">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there is a hint that they might be related. The guy on the pic sees similarities between the two (both are way too scary not to be related, lol) and then we see that Eileen is red-haired. Naturally we all think, 'Oh wow, Erza's mom is badass' but it should be confirmed soon in the next several chapters. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="33589">&lt;p&gt;You have already linked the entirety of the evidence for and against their relationship. As of right now in the manga, it is Hinted that they are related, but nothing has actually been said. There does seem to be a resemblance between Eleen and Erza, the power and hair, as well as looks, but that one panel you linked where Neinhart noted these things is all we have to go on. So until we dredge further into the manga, we will not get any answers to that question. I would fully expect for it to be true, but we are pretty much guaranteed to find out if it is or not eventually. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="33722">&lt;p&gt;Maybe Eileen IS Erza, in fact the future Erza. Look at the scar she has: it's like the injuries Erza has in her battle against her Historia. More, in the current chapter (489), Eileen says it's a magic form "the new era"! With the Eclipse Gate, time travel is certified possible in FT...&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37086">&lt;p&gt;Personally I think that Eileen is either Erza's mom or like, Erza from the future or something.
The reason I think she is Erza's mom is because of the few hints that they are related here and there in the manga. Some of you reading this might say that this is not possible since Erza and Eileen don't have the same name. The fact is we don't know if this is true or not. Your response might be saying that it is because Erza's last name is Scarlet and Eileen's last name is Bersilion. Well Scarlet is not Erza's real last name. If you didn't skip or if you remember in previous chapters of the manga/ previous episodes of the anime you will know that when Erza was enslaved and were with Jellal, Simon and the others she introduced herself as just Erza. Jellal is the one who gave a Erza her last name when she was a child.
The reason I think that she is Erza from the future is because in the end of chapter 507 it ends with Eileen saying to Erza "I am you and you are me"
But I am more for the Eileen being Erza's mom.
These are just my personal theories, more likely than not we will know the answer in upcoming chapters but for now we have to wait for these chapters to be released,&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon a &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1662038&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;MAL&lt;/a&gt; post. Which had a nice graph which displays that after a small peak in 2010, bleach had a significant drop in rank.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This same post also claims that this data was biased, as the ranking is determined per chapter. Aka, people didn't like the arc bleach was at.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This drop was also visible in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1289667&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;yearly sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt;November 23, 2009 to November 21, 2010: 5th place by selling 5,204,193 copies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;Nov 22nd 2010 - Nov 20th 2011. 8th place by selling 4,187,258 copies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;  &#10;  &lt;p&gt;November 21, 2011 to November 18, 2012. 12th place by selling 2,974,750 copies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, unlike in the below chart, the sales popularity seems to remain consistently above 2.5 Mil, until 2016, where it dropped to 2.2 Mil. Suggesting it's popularity just normalized, instead of really 'dropping'&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what really happened to Bleach? Did it really suffer from a significant drop in popularity as shown in the graph below? Or is this just misinterpreted data by a user?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONVJf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONVJf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43422">&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the MAL post itself, that graph was actually made by a YouTuber by the name of Super Eyepatch Wolf. He uses it specifically in a video where he goes in depth as to why Bleach had such a massive fall in popularity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ACq7tgjHdGA" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The Fall of BLEACH: How it Happened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend watching the video, but I will give a summary of the main points brought up in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Wolf's points is in regards to the author (Tite Kubo) of Bleach's drawing ability and it's deterioration in quality due to the difficulties of being a manga author. The start of Bleach really showcased Kubo's talent in drawing which really brought people into the the world of Bleach. However, the fatigue from the grueling schedule and the like had caused the drawing quality to suffer. This fatigue and frustration was also in part to relationship issues with his editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point was that Kubo's Story was not really cut out for the long term. He pointed out that several of the characters started out strong but was never really developed. Some even regressed. For one, the main character starts off as this interesting character but regresses to a less expressive reactive type character - compared to Naruto and One Piece where they are proactively going after their well-established goals. Also, at one point, the story stops shifting constantly (going from a typical monster of the week to the introduction of the Soul Society arc which tapped into teenager's feelings as the became a part of the foreign adult world to the amazing Aizen arc) and started recycling several of its previous tropes. This leads to the main problem of nothing really changes as pretty much after each arc everything gets a factory reset. The backlash from the fans and editorial department when these problems began to show really pushed it down in rankings, leading to its rushed three chapters to end it before it got canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence: Drawing and Drafting (drawing panels/ panel structure) quality diminished, the extremely difficult schedule of a mangaka and issues with his editor wore him down, and his story plot quality lost what gave it its wide appeal in the first place especially since it was not written for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer></question><question Id="43926" Title="If 17's aura isn't ki, what is it then?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In Dragon Ball, aura always meant ki. Recently, however, fighters without ki have been shown to have an aura. First 17, which now it's been explicitly stated he doesn't have ki. Kochiarator, which is a fusion of 3 robots, has been shown to have a sort of aura. And Anisa which is a fusion of 3 robots with a humanoid form definitely has an aura that isn't distinguishable from any other fighter's regular ki aura. So if 17's and other robots' aura aren't ki, what are they supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="43933">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is ki?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a form of life force energy used by characters in the Dragon Ball Universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We consider the aura to be a form of ki and yes it is! Rather than ki, you should look at it as energy. They might both sound very similar but look at it this way. The ki blast fired by a character is different from the ki used while flying. So the aura has to do more about powering up and using energy. A good way to look at the same is if Android 17 were to have unlimited ki in terms of strength, he would technically be stronger than even the Grand Priest because of his unlimited strength, however, the androids only have unlimited stamina(life-energy source).Think of Android 17's power up to him using all his strength. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We know all living beings in Dragon Ball have ki. We also know that the amount of ki can be increased or by &lt;b&gt;training&lt;/b&gt; and altered by  &lt;b&gt;transformations&lt;/b&gt; or special skills like the &lt;b&gt;Kaio-Ken&lt;/b&gt;. We also know that this &lt;b&gt;Ki&lt;/b&gt; is not unlimited irrespective of who the being is. There have been many instances where a character (&lt;b&gt;Didn't have enough energy to fight&lt;/b&gt;) or didn't have sufficient amount of energy to power up etc which is why they consume &lt;b&gt;Senzu beans&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Androids, on the other hand, have a special or unnatural energy source such that their ki capacity is unlimited. Unlike the other species(All species shown on Dragon Ball as of now). Due to the same, androids also have difficulty in sensing ki the way other species do and need special modifications to help locate a particular fighter.&lt;p&gt; There is not definite available answer but this is what I believe. I think the amount of ki associated with stamina and energy has nothing to do with one's strength. In other words, when Goku uses his Super Saiyan transformations and alters his ki, I don't think he gains more life support or more stamina(as a matter of fact, he loses more stamina), yet his ki is altered. The same applies with regard to the androids. The only difference is, the androids have an unlimited source of life-energy(Stamina associated ki). We know Android 17 and even 18 obviously have gotten a lot stronger since the android saga. If they had a fixed capacity of strength ki, they wouldn't have been able to get stronger. &lt;br&gt;Also, Koicherator, Aniraza, and the Androids shouldn't be confused with.&lt;li&gt;Koicherator is a robot. They are 100% mechanically designed. They can power up or gain energy only by physical manipulation i.e(By designing them that way or by using a special power-up like the one Dr.Paparoni used).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aniraza is a fusion between Paproni and the Robot. It is not technically a modification like in case of the androids. I would compare it to the Potara fusion and fusion dance. We know Kefla's ki increased both strength wise and even stamina wise after the Potara fusion. Aniraza could be compared to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, Android 17 is a cyborg. He was a human-modified with mechanical parts. He has a special modification in him which gives him unlimited stamina. Since he's part human, he does have an unnatural source of Ki and also has the ability to get stronger with training, unlike Koicherator and Aniraza. &lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="37700">&lt;p&gt;There are several soundtracks, or in some cases just singles, on iTunes, although of course availability will depend on region. Sometimes it can help to search for either an artist or a song title, and see what albums show up, but you have to be careful because for every actual version of an anisong, there are about twenty covers of varying quality and style (including entire albums where as far as I can tell they've taken a MIDI version of the songs and run it through a synthesiser to make it sound like church bells, for reasons that completely escape me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll get the best results if you're able to switch to the Japanese iTunes store, although there may be some hoops to jump through to make that work properly (for example, you can only buy something from a new region if you have no iTunes credit in your usual region). And, of course, everything's in Japanese - if you're not a speaker yourself, use Wikipedia or ANN or a similar site to find the Japanese name of the show you're looking for, and copy it into the search bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the script in Japanese:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#12431;&#12375;&lt;/strong&gt;&#12399;&#12518;&#12540;&#12525;&#12375;&#12363;&#12394;&#12356;&#12290;&lt;br&gt;
  &#12300;&lt;strong&gt;&#12431;&#12375;&lt;/strong&gt;&#12301;&#65311;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the literal translation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; only have Euros.&lt;br&gt;
  "&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;"?&lt;br&gt;
  Is there something on &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; face?&lt;br&gt;
  "&lt;strong&gt;My&lt;/strong&gt;"..? Hahaha!&lt;br&gt;
  (Everyone is laughing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Mina used &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%84%82#Japanese" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&#12431;&#12375; (&lt;em&gt;washi&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first-person pronoun used commonly for elderly, especially from Edo period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The term is generally only used by the elderly, and its use is often considered stereotypical of them. As such, it is frequently used in TV shows and comics to emphasize the age of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;More commonly spelled &#31169;, or in kana to make the reading explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anime/manga culture, if spoken by young girls, she can be considered as &#12525;&#12522;&#12496;&#12496;&#12450; (&lt;em&gt;loli baba&lt;/em&gt;, old loli): girls who look young but act old. (But since this is a one-off joke from her, Mina is not)&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I suspect there may be a &lt;em&gt;Your Lie in April&lt;/em&gt; title spoiler situation here, or quite possibly I'm just dense. I'm on episode 10 of &lt;em&gt;Parasyte -the Maxim-&lt;/em&gt; and I have been wondering the whole time what the title means.  At a guess, it could involve how episode 1 starts and ends.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone on Earth had a sudden thought.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;end:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone on Earth had a sudden thought. &quot;Life must be protected.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(The end quote appears at time mark 20:40.) The Google dictionary defines &lt;strong&gt;maxim&lt;/strong&gt; as &quot;a short, pithy statement expressing a general truth or rule of conduct&quot;.  So is that &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; maxim, &lt;em&gt;Life must be protected.&lt;/em&gt;? If so, there will probably be a further reveal late in the series. Or am I way off base?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the actual answer is a spoiler, please put it in a spoiler block. I'll hold off reading that part until finishing the series.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="38130">&lt;p&gt;I believe you are right on the mark that the maxim &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; "Life must be protected." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I remember, the theme is pretty consistent throughout the entire series, but the overarching idea tied to &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; maxim is that all life is valuable, regardless of species. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit philosophical for an anime about aliens that hijack human bodies and blend in so they can eat other humans while no one is looking, but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way that the series plays into this maxim is by seemingly asking "Who is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a monster?", as in "Who really deserves to live/die?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After the initial brutality of the Parasites, some of them start to realize that the best way to continue their existence is to co-exist with the humans. However, most humans oppose this idea completely, due to first impressions and not-so-peaceful Parasites. This idea comes to a climax in episode 21 where the presumed Parasite mayoral candidate Hirokawa condemns humans for not being able to live alongside Parasites and is shot to death. Only after this is it revealed that Hirokawa was fully human the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another scene that depicts Parasites as not complete monsters is in Episode 18,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;when Reiko sacrifices herself to save her son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way that this maxim is used throughout the series is the idea of &lt;em&gt;survival&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the Parasites simply seek to survive, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;as mentioned above, seek to cooperate with humans, though they are rejected entirely and effectively forced into hiding, lest they be hunted, as seen in Episodes 19-20.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="37370" Title="Which episode of Dragon Ball / Dragon Ball Z characteres started to have auras?" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was trying to make a list of all auras the Z fighters had in Dragon Ball, and knowing which episode characteres started to have auras will save me a lot of time. Which episode of Dragon Ball / Dragon Ball Z characteres started to have auras?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="37722">&lt;p&gt;It really depends on how strict of a definition for aura you're going for. What I mean is it would be one of two events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it could be when Master Roshi first performs the kamehameha in the original Dragon Ball series. He has a slight white aura around him. This is the first example of ki in the series so it may be what you mean. See: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQLaHEpx9w" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;YouTube video example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a more conventional aura would be when Gohan headbutts Raditz in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z. When he breaks out of the attack ball he gains a read aura and then proceeds to headbutt Raditz. See: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ko0XtJjJ28" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;YouTube video example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;It's of course understood that not all anime have been, nor will be dubbed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, are there any English dubbed anime on Crunchyroll? If there are, is there a setting for it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="7162">&lt;p&gt;Crunchyroll has a small number of shows with English dubs. These are listed on their forums &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-788825/crs-english-dubbed-anime"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I could not find a way to search for them, so I have no way of knowing if the list is complete or not, but in any event there probably aren't a lot more than what is listed there. There have been others in the past, but never a huge number. CR is still primarily concerned with subtitled anime, which are typically cheaper and more abundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other legal streaming sites which have larger collections of dubbed anime. What's available tends to vary significantly from country to country. In North America the biggest sources for legal dub streams are probably &lt;a href="http://www.theanimenetwork.com/"&gt;The Anime Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.funimation.com/"&gt;Funimation&lt;/a&gt;. I unfortunately don't know whether these are available to the rest of the world or what the popular alternatives are in other places.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In episode 2 of the anime, the characters start off in the Shiganshina district.  When and how did they get inside wall Maria?  It shows them on a river barge with other refugees, but I do not think that explains it.  Is there a gate on the river for the barge to go through?  If so, is the gate ever shown, explained or attacked?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26332">&lt;p&gt;The refugees just sailed into wall Maria. There isn't much more to it than that. As far as I know the river gates were never explained, but they have been shown. In chapter 1 you can see the river flow through the walls and in chapter 73 you can see in more detail how the river flows freely in and out the walls through bars. I assume them to be able to open similarly to the regular gates. They have not been attacked and it has not been explained why. At this point it makes more sense to attack the regular gates than the bars, seeing we don't even known whether &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13446/can-the-titans-swim"&gt;Titans can even swim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="42529">&lt;p&gt;The boat wasn't in Shinganshina District, it was in Wall Maria. The people living in Shinganshina had to run through the inner gate to get to the boat. In the anime a Garrison Regiment person yells for everyone to go through the inner gate and that there will be a boat on the other side that will take them to safety. Then the Garrison Regiment sets up cannons in front of the inner gate to protect the people trying to get onto the boat. A couple minutes later the Armored Titan appears, and breaches the inner gate. All the people see that the inner gate has been breached and they realize that their only option is to try to jump onto the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt; and realized that Lotton is a bit like a chuunibyou. He called himself &quot;The Wizard&quot; and he always wanted to make a cool entrance before a fight but usually got his ass kicked quickly. In my opinion, he's a chuuninbyou. But no one ever mention that he's chuunibyou. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Or probably he's not chuunibyou after all, but keep that for another question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being the earlier anime (&lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt; was aired in 2006 while &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt; was aired in 2012) it got me thinking about whether the word &quot;chuunibyou&quot; actually originated from this anime. Or probably it was not just as popular as now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="44054">&lt;p&gt;No, the word "chuunibyou" was not coined by the anime &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt; (nor by &lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt;). The term is attested back to 1999. (For further reading, the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou" rel="noreferrer"&gt;TVTropes article&lt;/a&gt; linked in &lt;a href="https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/44044/is-the-word-chuunibyou-originated-from-the-anime-chuuni#comment58985_44044"&gt;Aki Tanaka's comment&lt;/a&gt; seems good.)&lt;/p&gt;

Search volume for "chuunibyou" has since fallen off, but is somewhat higher than it was just before October 2012, even after you subtract out searches specifically for &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!&lt;/em&gt;. My point here is that in 2006 (unlike now), the word "chuunibyou" had very limited purchase and it is hence unsurprising that it would not be used in &lt;em&gt;Black Lagoon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Tachibana feels relaxed and persuades Ono to work for him as a chef/patissier. However, Ono is a guy of "irresistible Charm" now and gives Tachibana nightmares by trying to seduce him.
  At this cake shop called Antique, an incident from Tachibana's childhood is revealed, and a variety of cakes is presented. This is a delightful comedy anime&lt;/p&gt;

Also, Lola comes and saves Nami from Absalom even though they are enemies and Lola was given order to fight Straw Hat crew?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="26032">&lt;p&gt;The Zombies are created when a deceased/artificially created body is infused with another living person's shadow. The shadow possesses it's own will, think Ryouma's body with Brook's shadow and how they fought, with the zombie disregarding Moriya completely for quite some time, as Brook is mentioned to have fought Ryouma/Shadow Brook for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not uncommon for other shadows to be able to overpower Moriya's attempted control, or at the very least, where their basic instincts and impulses, ingrained into their very personalities is concerned. The Straw Hat crew zombies, like the pug Inuppe and the Jigoro constantly fighting, like their originals, Sanji and Zoro.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="29936">&lt;p&gt;The answer can be found when Moria infuses Oars' body with Luffy's shadow, in Chapter 457. Moria is the Master of Shadows; when he is talking to a shadow directly, he has complete control over them. Therefore, it is during that time that he needs to give details directives to the shadows &lt;strong&gt;before he infuses the shadow in the Zombie's body&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if he does explicitly state that the shadow should forget everything about his past, his personality might remain with the Zombie. Note that Luffy's personality remained at first because of the size difference between the shadow's original body and Oar's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Hogback states, they were not always aware of those rules and therefore made some mistakes with a number of Zombies (the only confirmed case is Cindy). We can however extend that theory to other Zombies which did not necessarily obey their masters perfectly, like Lola.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Well, I've really been thinking for this for a long time now and still I can't understand what Naruto means when he said that Sasuke is the one that accepted him and his existence more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="8247">&lt;p&gt;The quote you are talking about,  most likely is this one used in Shippuuden&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Way back, I used to hate Sasuke... But once I got used to being with him I realized he's really a lot of fun... to be around...&lt;strong&gt;he's the person that, more than anyone else accepted me and my existence.&lt;/strong&gt; Sasuke is my friend... and he represents bonds that I waited so long to receive, so that's why... &lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Naruto%3a_Shipp%C5%ABden" rel="nofollow"&gt;- Uzumaki Naruto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point in the story you should already know how hated Naruto was in town, and how nobody would acknowledge him as he was the scary nine-tails. But then Sasuke came along, which in Naruto's eyes was similar to him as they where both &lt;em&gt;'alone'&lt;/em&gt;. They started to build up a rival like relationship, pretty much the same as Kakashi and Gai have a rivalship. At this point Sasuke did no longer see him as the "dangerous  9 tailed", and slowly started to acknowledge Naruto as an equal, a rival, and as a friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In episode 132 just after Sasuke says that skilled shinobi can read each others minds during combat, without even saying a word. There is a insight on how Naruto looks at Sasuke from 13:07 ~ 18:28 . Something similar happens in Shippuuden as well, just after the battle with Danzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</answer><answer Id="8249">&lt;p&gt;Well we know that from the start people of Konoha hated Naruto and were afraid of him because of him being the nine-tails Jinchuriki.
But when he met Sasuke he felt that Sasuke was also alone, just like him. That Sasuke didn't hate him and wasn't afraid of him. And in time he developed a bond with him, A bond of understanding. Naruto felt that Sasuke is just like him.
In the Zabuza incident Sasuke was ready to sacrifice himself to save Naruto, this had a great effect on him. From that day he developed an inexplicable bond with him. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="47052">&lt;p&gt;I guess accepting someone means really acknowledging that person and Naruto always acknowledged Sasuke when it comes to competing. Naruto never cared as to what others are doing. He was pin pointed at Sasuke as Sasuke was getting a lot of attention and Naruto always wanted to be acknowledged and known like Sasuke.
Sasuke never acknowledged much people in his life but he always acknowledged Naruto more than anyone as he always competed with him all the time.Both were catching up with each other. Both wanted to become stronger than other.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it was something like, she wakes up one day and goes to school, where she realizes some people smell funny. I think later some dude tells her she can smell when the people around her are sexually aroused. I know it sounds really weird for me to be searching for this... It's not that I want to read it thatt much, but I just remembered reading it and it's bothering me since I can't seem to find it...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="19652">&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure it's &lt;a href="https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=4542" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Para Paru&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a shoujo manga about a girl who wakes up one day finding herself being able to smell certain scents from the people around her. She also hears a strange voice inside her head. Later with the help of a friend, she finds out that an alien got inside and is now living in her head, and it is the one responsible for giving her the enhanced ability of smell. The certain scents are explained and analysed to be associated to sexual arousal and physical attraction, as well as dishonesty and nervousness, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other people in the same school who receive similar abilities in taste, touch and hearing. The manga is ongoing and touches on sensitive and mature matters such as rape and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;In Dragon Ball Resurrection of Freezer, Goku, when transformed in Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, is almost killed by a laser beam from Sorbet. Now how could this happen? Was his ki so low even when he was a SSGSS? Later in the Dragon Ball Super series this seems to be corrected because he isn't transformed when he is hit. But then again, I don't know which is the version that counts, supposedly the manga is over the movie and series but between something that happens in the movie and series I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the question of this topic is: can a transformed Saiyan (Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan God, etc.) lower his ki to base-human level when transformed? Was this just a mistake or what?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="34262">&lt;p&gt;There are kind of multiple issues wrapped into one here. Firstly, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can a super saiyan their ki to the point that it is human level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No that is impossible. Why? Because it takes a great amount of energy to undergo and sustain a physical transformation. If you drop your ki below a certain point. You revert to your base form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Goku death by beam? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes that can also happen. It seems almost impossible in theory but remember saiyans are in fact humanoid aliens and as such they can fall vulnerable to being shot in the back if they lower their ki sense. Whis warns Goku of this when he tells him during their training and in the manga that he gets too overconfident easily and lowers his guard and that is his weakness which is the polar opposite of Vegeta who is too on-guard and thus gets slowed down. (I can link the manga panel later). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is. Goku was confident of victory which is why he was able to be shot. &lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="37371">&lt;p&gt;The comment marked as answer is WRONG. Re-watch the Cell Saga, especially after Goku and Gohan leave the time chamber. Whether or not their powered down super saiyan form is to the level of a "human" is debatable, but the characters did mention Goku and Gohan seemed like normal people. Later on, we saw that for Gohan to get to SSj2, was to make SSj1 feel like your normal state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*removed the word Necessary. There are the DBZ encyclopedia books out there, it said you needed more anger to reach SSJ2 from SSj1-so I apologize for that.&lt;/p&gt;

Body="&lt;p&gt;Whenever Naruto sees the Kyuubi that Minato sealed inside him, we see this room with water on the floor and a big door behind which the Kyuubi stays. What is this place and where is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="53025">&lt;p&gt;The place that we see is within Naruto's subconsciousness and its as a result of the &lt;a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Sealing_Style" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Eight Tetragram pattern&lt;/a&gt; which is the sealing formula used by Minato to seal the Nine tails within Naruto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the Wiki, When Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways. The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer><answer Id="53066">&lt;p&gt;The seal is an anchor that binds the two together. The Kyuubi in theory is a mass of chakra that was given sentience by the Sage of Six Paths. Fuinjutsu or the art of sealing allows them to seal them away. The Tailed beast exist in a sub-conscience as a by-product of the seal. Depending on the nature of the seal defines how they are locked up. Kushina is in a field with Kyuubi chained up while Naruto has it in a cage in a complex similar to a sewer. In theory, the Kyuubi exist in a sub-conscience while it's chakra is sealed aswell, slowly to merge with Naruto's. If your wondering about the shared space where they all meet, it is a result of the Sage's link he made when telling the Tailed Beast he's dying.&lt;/p&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="5216" Title="If the anime came first, what is considered &quot;canon&quot;?" Body="&lt;p&gt;In the case of many anime where the manga came first, things that are included in the anime but not the manga (such as filler arcs) seem to be not considered totally canon to the series, indicating that manga is generally what is considered to set canon. One example of this is the Quincy arc in Bleach. For series where the anime came first, such as Code Geass, is the anime then considered to set canon?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="5219">&lt;p&gt;What is considered canon is generally decided by the author(s) or license holder. I think you need to get a better idea of the definition of canon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the original work from which the fan fiction author borrows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a descriptor of specific incidents, relationships, or story arcs that take place within the overall canon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canon_(fiction)&amp;amp;oldid=573082785#cite_note-4" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Original revision&lt;/a&gt; where definitions came from)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to directly answer your question, if there was &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a manga and anime, and the manga came first, then the manga is canon. I say only, because many manga and anime are based off of light novels or visual novels. In that case, the light novel or visual novel would be canon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the anime came first, then it will probably be whatever the license holder decides is canon. This is an assumption, because I think anime writers give up the rights to their work.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="5225">&lt;p&gt;When a series is presented in several media, most of the versions will usually be said to be "based on" some other version, and whichever version is not "based on" anything of the others is canon. Under normal circumstances, that one is the one that came first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is only a general guideline. Sometimes things get strange. Consider &lt;em&gt;Revolutionary Girl Utena&lt;/em&gt;, which has no fewer than four presentations: the manga, the TV series, the movie, and the manga of the movie. The movie-manga is based on the movie, of course, but the other three are considered separate canons. Sort of. Like I said, Utena is strange.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20738">&lt;p&gt;Canon is whatever the rights holder (people who own the IP) says it is. Canon is always changing. Just look at the American comic industry, DC and Marvel are always retconning and reinventing the canon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The&#160;Summoning: Impure World Reincarnationbinds the soul of a deceased person to a living vessel, restoring them as they were when they were alive in order to do their summoner's bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;A reincarnated individual will have all the abilities they had during their life, including&#160;kekkei genkai&#160;and&#160;kekkei t&#333;ta. They are physically restored as they were at the time of their death, including any physical handicaps they may have possessed, such as&#160;Nagato's damaged legs. Exceptions exist: illnesses they had will not be preserved, nor will any physical damage that contributed to their death. There is some inconsistency of whether or not foreign body matter will be restored as well:&#160;Hanz&#333;&#160;retains the poison gland of the&#160;black salamander, but&#160;Madara Uchiha&#160;does not have access to&#160;Hashirama Senju's genetic material and thus Kabuto must artificially reproduce it for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There may have been mention of others, but they were not developed or mentioned much to the extent of my memory. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think that we were introduced to Android 8 in &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; (the episode where Goku is ascending up the Muscle Tower with a new foe on each floor, one of which was Ninja Murasaki who on finding himself outmatched, ordered Android 8 to fight Goku, if I remember correctly).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, I do not remember any mention of Androids 1-7, 9-15, and 21+, if they exist.

&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;Android 8 a.k.a. Eighter or Hat-San&lt;/strong&gt;, as you rightly said, he had been depicted in the &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/em&gt; manga, anime and the movies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;Android 13-15&lt;/strong&gt; were introduced in the 7th movie, &lt;em&gt;Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13!&lt;/em&gt; and were the first few killing machines built successfully with the aim of killing &lt;em&gt;Goku&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  strength when he has at least one other person cheering him on, enough
  to send two captain-level Shinigami flying with a single strike.
  He grows durable enough to become resistant to a repeated direct
  attack from Kensei's Bankai. The power also allows him to
  regenerate from damage, with James's cheers healing his damaged
  eardrums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's indeed strange, as he could not listen to James cheering, but as you can see it's never mentioned the word "hear" or "listen".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can assume that he don't need to listen to the cheers. James only had be there, cheering, that's enough to active his ability.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Subaru makes use of the one thing that makes him somewhat useful which is his role as a bait. He tries to spread the witch&#8217;s miasma and attract the whale with it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A peaceful demon, Suika, who cooks wonderful meals allows the Sanzo Party to stay at their village overnight. During the night, she sings and visits all of their dreams, extracting their painful memories from them and making them "happy." The next day, Sanzo and the others, except Goku, are all acting funny and lifeless. When confronted by Lirin on the road, Sanzo tosses the Maten Scripture at her when she demands it and goes back to Suika's village with Hakkai and Gojyo. Yaone tells Goku a story about a demon that extracts painful memories. Goku and the others head back to the village to try and free the others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Sanzo party meet a woman who cooks so terribly, people actually use her food as weapons against demons! Goku tries her food and gets sick, though. Hakkai realizes, however, that she really wants to be a good cook for her boyfriend, even though her horirble-tasting food makes for a handy weapon. Hakkai gives her cooking lessons, but when he tries her food, he passes out! Her boyfriend is horrified to hear they're eating her food, and Hakkai tries to explain that she wants to cook well. Her boyfriend decides he'll try her food for himself, as horrible as it may be. As she makes a dish, a demon attacks. She throws the soup on the demon and he disentrigrates. Her boyfriend tries her food, though, and finds it delicious. Sanzo decides that her food kills demons, similar to the way the banishing gun bullets kill them. As thanks for helping her, she gives them all a plate of meat buns, but Hakkai, Gojyo, and Goku don't want to eat them. On their way out, though, they run into a bunch of demons...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</answer></question><question Id="20571" Title="What are Trebol's powers?" Body="&lt;p&gt;According to the wiki page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Trebol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Trebol&lt;/a&gt;, he should be a Logia user, using the Sticky Fruit's powers. This was verified in chapters 741 and 760, when we could see Trebol completely unaffected after being cut into pieces by Usopp and Law. Now chapter 782 makes me really confused.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YUFYT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#10;  &lt;p&gt; In chapter 782, we could see how he was hit by Luffy, yet remained completely unharmed despite being hit with hardening Haki. Logia users should be hurt by attacks like these. Additionally, later in the chapter we can see Law cut his body open with his sword. This could be defended by the fact that Law could have imbued the sword with Haki, but the appearance of Trebol's shriveled up old body, makes me really think Trebol was Paramecia after all. Although a Paramecia should not have been able to live after having his body severed. Now what's the deal here?&lt;br&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#10; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/aM269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#10;"><answer Id="20695">&lt;p&gt;I truly believe he is a Logia user, it just makes sense. I agree that he used his powers to make his mucus outer shell. I believe he activates his full Logia powers when he needs to, thereby making his coat an extension of his body. Then he refrains from using his powers to keep his real body separate from his coat so as not to be hurt by haki users. So opponents never really know what they are hitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I compare him to a jello mold with a piece of pineapple in the center. Hard to get to that pineapple by simple means lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also agree that Law's sword was imbued with haki to hurt him. They were in Law's Room after all, so it is quite possible that he was able to gain control of his arm and attach haki.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20808">&lt;p&gt;There are still things to clarify so far.&lt;br&gt;
Right now, he may be  paramecia or logia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logia&lt;/strong&gt; because of how flexible he can be and surviving after being cut by Law.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Paramecia&lt;/strong&gt; because he may be just like Magellan who produces poison out of his body but cannot transform his body to be entirely made of poison. Both of them just produce the material out of their bodies. He survived Law's cutting maybe because of his very thin and flexible body that he could hide it in his very thick mucus.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="20949">&lt;p&gt;Many are using the argument that Trebol hid within a piece of his body to evade Usopp's attack and that Luffy missed him because of how skinny he is. Trebol's height never changed. Even after losing his outer layer he was still just as tall. So for him to hide within his body like that would mean he'd have to be a contortionist with mad skills. And the angle and way he was looking through the hole Luffy made would suggest he could move his neck and body in a way that would snap a normal human spine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the anime, after Usopp's attack, Trebol reforms himself entirely. You can see his hand reform as it is grabbing his staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trebol's devil fruit type is a mystery so far. Oda will have to confirm which he truly is. If he reforms himself after the explosion then we will have our answer. I still believe he is a Logia user.&lt;/p&gt;
</answer><answer Id="27276">&lt;p&gt;I would like to share these speculations from various users:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why Trebol is not a logia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SBS Oda said that Logia is typically a "force of nature" which "sticky stuff" is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His entire outer appearance is probably created by the goo and has the ability to hide his real body anywhere inside and that makes him looks a logia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is a paramecia type like Buggy. You could cut up buggy into a million pieces and he can reform again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people in the series tend to have a secondary skill. He could be incredibly flexible and could have hid in one of the halfs of his body when Usopp cuts him to pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Law might have used haki on his blade to severely cut him (but we haven't seen that Haki works like that even when the user part is cut he can still use haki). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trebol makes a statement "Am I even a logia?" &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Trebol a logia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ussop and Law cut him into multiple pieces but each time without any haki or room ability being involved, so they didnt damage his actual body which is logia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trebol's actual "logia body" is the skinny one. He creates the substance and it clings to his sticky body and wears the huge coat to give the appearance of being a huge target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being skinny he's incredibly tall with a long limb. He could not possibly scrunch up his limbs in a impossible speed enough to "hide" in his half when Usopp cut him to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luffy's haki didn't hurt maybe because he purposefully let the attack pass through because he said  "Logia means nothing to me".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oda committed a mistake on Trembols power. Noticed that he did create a mistake for the power of Moria during the battle in Marineford. Zombies appeared in bandages during the battle at marineford just using shadows of marine soldiers.(Hogback should be at the scene to create those body of zombies and shadows was taken under the sunlight, marines should have evaporated along with the zombies). But Oda just let it slide because Moria will be useless at the Marineford if he doesn't have that power. Maybe the same happened to Trembol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After reading all discussions about Trebol I came with this conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its not clearly confirmed if Trebol is a Paramecia or Logia type. I think this issue will remain ambiguous until Oda confirms the facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
