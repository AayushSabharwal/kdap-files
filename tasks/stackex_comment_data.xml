Also, how would the sleep PKs mentioned in anime and novel happen?</comment><comment Id="180" ParentId="133">There is no such a thing as a player with a red Cursor. The Cursor can be green, and the cursor can be orange. It turns orange once you hit player with green cursor outside a duel and out of safe area. It doesn't matter if you killed him afterwards, robbed them, or just ran away. The cursor revert back overtime to green the first three times. On the fourth time, you have to complete a quest. It permanently turns orange the fifth time. Red guilds/players are something that made up by players to differentiate murderers.</comment><comment Id="186" ParentId="133">@Krazer I don't think that's true. Although I don't have the show in front of me to double-check, the assassination group that was sent to kill off the main characters at the end of the inner-PK arc were red I believe.</comment><comment Id="187" ParentId="133">Found it: [Red Players](http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Red_Players)</comment><comment Id="190" ParentId="133">@Mysticial That's not how it goes in the [light novel](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Sword_Art_Online:Volume_8_Chapter_1#Part_11).

Also this sentence: "In a certain sense, they were the biggest enemy of the clearing group, bigger than the boss monsters, the red players." There are a few more but I'm sure two will suffice. Just search for "red player".</comment><comment Id="209" ParentId="133">@atlantiza PK guilds and players in SAO are dubbed "Red" by players to differentiate them from normal criminals, because their cursor color is also orange.

The anime did a great job, but the VN has a few hundreds of hours of content and fitting that into 49 episodes is just impossible.

Talking about promotion abroad, in the last few years in Italy, a Japan stand was present in [some comic conventions](http://www.it.emb-japan.go.jp/image/romics2012_it.pdf) to promote Japanese culture among anime and manga enthusiasts (JNTO, Japan Foundation, Embassy of Japan).

On the other hand, since the natures could be [arranged in a circle](http://www.leafninja.com/jutsu.php), only by having two natures would they always be unblocked. When you combine three, at least one of them is blocking another one. Take Jinton: Doton stands unblocking and unblocked, but Katon would be blocking Fuuton. At least I think this is the way it'd go. Maybe, this means that used together they do not block each other, thus making it **possible** to use all 5 together. No?</comment><comment Id="438" ParentId="307">Also, [Mei](http://www.leafninja.com/biographies-M.php#5thMizukage) is able to combine the Katon and the Suiton to create [Futton](http://www.leafninja.com/kekkei.php). The thing is the 'order' in which you apply them: she applies the Katon **on top** of the Suiton. The other way around it'd block it.</comment><comment Id="439" ParentId="307">@JNat: Yeah, the combination is vital. I think that a 5 element-combination isn't possible, because all 5 elements can't be combined at a time - There would be 1 blocked elements. If you don't use all elements together, you can 'order' them to make them work together. I'll edit my answer :).</comment><comment Id="440" ParentId="307">I think that it may be possible to combine the five elements, taking into consideration the order in which you'd do it. You considered that it is not possible for 5 because at least 1 would be blocked. However, if you were to do 2 quick combinations of 2 elements (and leave the 5th out for now), you'd have 2 **new elements**. Then you'd be able to combine them with the fifth one, and possibly it wouldn't be blocked (since the *'compound'* element is not the basic element). Is my thinking right?</comment><comment Id="449" ParentId="308">Kakashi may have mastered so many because the Sharingan gave him insight into how opponents manipulated those chakras - it's a "copy eye", after all.</comment><comment Id="451" ParentId="213">Just to add my 2cents: when sites are in beta (public and private), they are seem as promising when fulfill some requirements, and being popular (having more than 500 visits/day).

ReACT Final Tuned, should have everything you want. Some characters have story lines the continue in Actress Again, that you might miss if you don't play the original game. ReACT's Story Mode stays the same as the original. The game the plays out in a branching tree path.

The Kohaku no J&#333;hei (Amber Purifying Pot) was the only one in the Fourth Raikage's possession, and thus Kinkaku and Ginkaku did not have it when they were revived. The other tools they used were not taken over by someone else in the living world after they died, and thus were available to them.</comment><comment Id="1166" ParentId="1970">If Suigetsus Sword was taken away, that means, that someone else possessed it. Wouldn't it be more logical, that Kabuto possessed the sword and gave it to Zabuza, instead of Edo Tensei?</comment><comment Id="1167" ParentId="1970">@looper It is a good point, but it is highly unlikely that Kabuto infiltrated the room where the sword was kept just to get that sword. It was just left unattended in that room (see picture), which meant it was not in anyone's possession per se. Or maybe his "upgraded" Edo Tensei allows him to control real world objects through the revived shinobi, and he decided not to bother getting the swords held by Bee and Chojuro. Again, this is speculation.</comment><comment Id="1168" ParentId="1970">From what I recall, Kinkaku took their tools from his mouth. This could mean that they were somehow sealed with some special jutsu, something like the way Gerotora was once inside Jiraiya's stomach and then inside Naruto's.</comment><comment Id="1173" ParentId="1970">looper and JNat, Thanks for those points! I had missed that.</comment><comment Id="1186" ParentId="311">I changed my accepted answer from Alenanno's to this one, because I've been researching and I also came to the conclusion that those that master the Rinnegan can master all **six elements** of chakra (as explained by Jiraiya in chapter 375, page 11). Considering that the Rikudo Sennin existed (which the Bijuu confirm), this means that there was at least one person who could do this. Considering this, this answer is a better fit than the other one, leaving only the matter of **mixing** the elements unanswered.</comment><comment Id="1216" ParentId="2041">According to Choujurou (chapter 468, page 10) Kisame has a high level of chakra even without Samehada. However, the combination of him and the sword make an extremely larger amount of chakra available to him. And he also seems to be able to absorb chakra even without Samehada (possibly because he is in direct contact with water), as shown in chapter 506, page 5.</comment><comment Id="1217" ParentId="2041">I don't think Sasuke qualifies as a genius.

So how does that settle with your theory?</comment><comment Id="1240" ParentId="2069">@MadaraUchiha I don't see why you think it's incompatible. Naruto is stubborn but the good side of this is that he works hard and trains until he sees results because he believes in himself, in order to show everyone else his value.

Assuming the battery still provides a 50V voltage, it needs a discharge current of 6kW/50V = 120A!

For the Rasengan he found a way to form it using clones, while a Genius would have just done it without that kind of help.</comment><comment Id="3756" ParentId="4442">This monk is Ikkyuu and the warrior guy is Shin'emon, both from *[Ikkyuu-san](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1461)*.</comment><comment Id="3765" ParentId="4442">Sadly it doesn't explain why they are inside the tower on her head xD</comment><comment Id="3766" ParentId="4442">All the other characters have things on their heads too - one has a tank :D</comment><comment Id="3767" ParentId="4442">Do they also have people in there?</comment><comment Id="3768" ParentId="4442">Not in what I've read so far, but it's a strange manga, so I wouldn't be suprised</comment><comment Id="3780" ParentId="4468">Can you elaborate a little more?

Any ideas?</comment><comment Id="3782" ParentId="4468">Well, if this were an older manga than "Welcome to the NHK", then, if I'm still right, at least partially, Purrurin in that series might have been based on an older idea.</comment><comment Id="3791" ParentId="4462">Note that the "combining" here refers to element **fusion** (i.e. Water and Ground creates Wood). What Kakuzu used was to mix the Fire and Wind to create an enhanced technique, which was countered by Yamato and Naruto Wind+Water mix. Much like if you take a powder of copper and zinc, you get a mix of the two powders. Melt the two together, and you get brass.</comment><comment Id="3813" ParentId="4485">That part which you describe is 100% filler.

The right order would be either the production order of the novels or the anime. If you watch in chronological order it will be somewhat more confusing IMO and you'd spoil some things.</comment><comment Id="4109" ParentId="4695">@LoganM same could be said for Kara no Kyoukai, the production order is the chapter order but storyline it's 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6 -&gt; ReMix -&gt; 7 -&gt; 8, in the end of The Hollow Shrine (Chapter 4) you see Araya contact Rio, Fujino and Kirie because his is in Chapter 5, if you watch it in story order you get spoiled in that Kirie's 2nd body was given to her by Araya before the events of chapter 1 while doing something to Fujino after she slaughtered most of the gang who gang raped her but before meeting Mikiya but the spoiler isn't all that bad, it just makes you think about what he's plan</comment><comment Id="4110" ParentId="4695">@LoganM there's another example where you see how a bad guy become transfigured and demented as the greatest evil but i can't remember the series</comment><comment Id="4121" ParentId="4708">It's not mentioned anywhere that it does.</comment><comment Id="4130" ParentId="4714">While I agree all ocular techniques use chakra, that doesn't necessarily mean they cause strain. Sasuke could probably keep on his normal 3 tomoe sharingan for the whole day and while it may consume chakra, I doubt it will strain his eyes. At this point, only using the mangekyou seem to do that. It seems pretty normal to always have rinnegan on, where as sharingan and byukagan get turned off, so it might cause no strain. This is all just speculation though.</comment><comment Id="4131" ParentId="4708">In Naruto, Byakugan and Sharingan strain are slightly different though. Byakugan strain is just temporary while Sharingan users actually start going (permanently) blind from too much usage. I'm pretty sure Rinnegan causes no strain as people like Pain were constantly using it. On the other hand, people like Tobi turned off his Sharingan quite often.</comment><comment Id="4149" ParentId="4708">Only overuse of Mangekyu leads to blindness I think. Normal Sharingan does not.</comment><comment Id="4153" ParentId="4736">It is reference to [&#24375;&#21147;&#12431;&#12363;&#12418;&#12392;](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%8F%E3%81%8B%E3%82%82%E3%81%A8-%E5%BC%B7%E5%8A%9B%E3%82%8F%E3%81%8B%E3%82%82%E3%81%A8-1000%E9%8C%A0/dp/B000FQUH9I), at least from my understanding of this page http://kokuuma.jugem.jp/?eid=92 (which talks about the scene from Blade Runner).</comment><comment Id="4169" ParentId="4721">i've never head of Onimonogatari, Otorimonogatari, Koimonogatari and Hanamonogatari, they anime aswell or another media altogether (manga, light novel)</comment><comment Id="4173" ParentId="4721">yep they are part of monogatari series (Lignt Novel) by  Nishio Ishin .</comment><comment Id="4213" ParentId="4765">Well, based on the *s in the subs, it's more likely the Shakugan no Shana-tan specials.</comment><comment Id="4218" ParentId="4776">Since animators and studios usually outsource work, it's probably a lot easier when both the studio and the outsourcer are near each other.

So, most likely, it's really pointing toward [Shakugan no Shana III](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6773/Shakugan_no_Shana_III_%28Final%29). That would fit the number of * there. However, since I was unsure as to which series of the franchise it was referring to, I just put there the name of the franchise itself.</comment><comment Id="4228" ParentId="4784">I don't understand this question. It seems like you have 2 examples which could be using this for very different reasons. Furthermore, I don't think [tropes] applies as this isn't referenced particularly often in anime, at least not in comparison to other media. IMO it would be much better if you just split it into two separate questions, one about FMA and another about NGE, and were more specific with the question. Right now, it seems to be more about the Kabbalistic tree of life than anime.</comment><comment Id="4233" ParentId="4765">But they do have -tan in the title... http://blog-imgs-31-origin.fc2.com/s/h/i/shige0819/20070403214019.jpg Since this took place in Index-tan, I think it's quite likely it's referring to the -tan counterpart in the Shana franchise.</comment><comment Id="4235" ParentId="4765">The link you provided is dead.</comment><comment Id="4237" ParentId="4765">http://shakugan.wikia.com/wiki/Shakugan_no_Shana-tan

If Kishi didn't create another plothole, then Madara read that God Tree part without Rinnegan.

Since only kanji there, no hiragana at all, and well eventhough there's a possibility it's ancient Japanese, but given character's background, I also agree it's likely Chinese.</comment><comment Id="5062" ParentId="5285">@monkry Yes, indeed. The reason I didn't want to say conclusively that it was not Japanese is because you *can* form some sentences with kanji only.

Conventional wisdom is that modern-era Kyoto Animation has some of the longest production cycles in the industry, so I'd put most anime as having closer to ~1-1.5-years of pre-production.

That do not count as Uchiha DNA. He used Hashirama's cells in his body(hand to be precise) to keep the Sharingans. Just having the eye doesn't mean having the DNA and that's the reason he never could have awakened the Rinnegan. If just having the Sharingan means having Uchiha DNA, then why wasn't Kakashi able to turn of the Sharingan? That's because only with the Sharingan blood, you get the ability to turn off and on the Sharingan.</comment><comment Id="7038" ParentId="6035">@MadaraUchiha - You can say that Obito wasn't *strong enough/smart enough/"potent"* enough to awaken the Rinnegan, despite having the Uchiha blood and the Senju DNA. That's why he took the Rinnegan from Nagato's corpse. :)</comment><comment Id="7039" ParentId="6035">@R.J, I think madara mentioned about danzo not strong enough to awaken rinnegan. Btw, Does obito have senju DNA??</comment><comment Id="7040" ParentId="6035">@RikuduSennin - Ofcourse he does. When Madara found him, the right side of body was completely damaged. It was reconstructed it using Hashirama's living clone(which Madara had created). Therefore, Obito technically has half body of an Uchiha and the rest half of a Senju.</comment><comment Id="7041" ParentId="6035">@RikuduSennin - Can you give me the reference of that(where Madara mentions about Danzo not being strong enough to awaken Rinnegan)? Because I firmly believe that Danzo never had the Uchiha DNA with him.</comment><comment Id="7043" ParentId="6034">@R.J I have a question here. DNA can be taken even from a person's hair, which means it can be taken from eye also. Since danzo was able to control the sharingans, he had them connected with his body. Doesn't it mean he had DNA's of uchiha?? Please clarify :)</comment><comment Id="7044" ParentId="6034">@RikuduSennin - Yeah it can be taken from the hair, but not the eye. Even kakashi was able to control Obito's Sharingan, but that doesn't mean he had the Uchiha DNA. I really feel that by just having a Sharingan gives you the Uchiha DNA.</comment><comment Id="7053" ParentId="6035">hair, spit, yes even the eye would count as dna</comment><comment Id="7054" ParentId="6034">every cell in ur body contains dna</comment><comment Id="7077" ParentId="6099">The division wasn't linear, `Tail` isn't a unit for power.</comment><comment Id="7079" ParentId="6099">Btw, we had a question about the tail-count before: http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/1940/122</comment><comment Id="7090" ParentId="3533">3 Simple words.

I'll bookmark your blog and visit it weekly for your new posts.</comment><comment Id="7234" ParentId="6204">I think any Uchiha can use Izanami or Izanagi provided they know about the jutsu. There is no pre-condition of them having awakened the Mangekyou because if that was the case, then Danzo couldn't have used it so many times. All you need is an activated Sharingan and the knowledge about the jutsu.</comment><comment Id="7243" ParentId="6204">Which Danzou reason are you talking about? Even if Danzou didn't have that Mangekyou but had learnt about Izanami/Izanagi from someone, he could have used the jutsu. Since he already had Shisui's Mangekyou, he read it from the stone tablet I guess. But that was not the point here. The point was that you don't need a Mangekyou to use Izanami/Izanagi. All you need is an awakened Sharingan along with the jutsu's knowlegdem, which can be got from others or from the tablet(for this Mangekyou is required).</comment><comment Id="7244" ParentId="6204">Just to clarify, my original post never said that MS was a requirement to use Izanagi. However, to clear any misunderstanding, my edit explicitly states that Izanagi is not an MS technique.</comment><comment Id="7245" ParentId="6204">*With that said, Shisui is definitely capable of using Izanami as so should any other Uchiha member that awakens their mangekyou.* - This statement of yours was the one I was talking about. And also, I said that Izanagi and Izanami is not a Mangekyou technique and even(in the edit addressing to my comments) you're saying that only. I don't get why a clarification for that is required.</comment><comment Id="7246" ParentId="6204">Clarification is required because my statement isn't false. You only chose to interpret it as **Mangekyou Sharingan is a requirement to use Izanami** and disregarded my previous sentences, explaining kinjutsu and the Uchiha stone tablet. I thought it was clear that the reference to the Mangekyou Sharingan implied reading the stone tablet. I figured I didn't need to state that Izanagi was not an MS technique because Danzou didn't use the MS for it, but you read my answer and interpreted otherwise.</comment><comment Id="7247" ParentId="6204">That is because you did not mention that all Izanami/Izanagi required was a Sharingan and the jutsu knowledge. That's what lead to the confusion. Anyways, I guess the answer now though not fully confusion free, is still a good one.

Background on the other hand, for a character, includes the elements of his or her history and experience. Things such as family history, education, work experience, hobbies, etc. can fit into a character's background.

According to the wiki Luffy and Boa should be affected and it shouldn't be possible for Boa Hancock to take a bath like that. They can only take a shower, not a bath.

The manga just finished, and is considerably longer than the anime, so you might want to watch the anime first, or read the manga alongside the anime (which is what I did).

The anime really captures the atmosphere that the manga builds.

Your hypothetical is either in clear conflict with the basic principles, or is a fanfic that is supposing mechanics never indicated or established in the source.</comment><comment Id="16950" ParentId="13447">http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/11424/8024 The first part of this answer seems otherwise germane.</comment><comment Id="16951" ParentId="13447">@zibadawatimmy Hmm... just to clarify my understanding of your comment: if a Shinigami sees that a perfectly healthy, newborn baby only has a lifespan of a few days, does that mean the baby absolutely _will_ die within a few days, presumably due to some external cause (e.g. a car accident; not counting the Death Note)? I was under the impression that one's lifespan was as defined as in the question, hence my confusion. If you can provide more sources (e.g. quotes/events from the manga) in addition to Misa's, please elevate this to an answer.</comment><comment Id="16960" ParentId="13466">The original lifespan can only be shorten by a death note. But let's say, he is destined to die of radiation, he will die of radiation, because the death note can't prolong the life of someone.</comment><comment Id="16978" ParentId="13447">@erpmine My understanding is the same as timmy. Your lifespan is predetermined at birth, but the way you live your life until that moment is not predetermined. So yes, the healthy baby will die of an external cause, eg car accident. Unless, by some coincidence, the driver of that car was killed by use of the Death Note. At that point a bunch (or maybe even all of them) of lifespans are recalculated, but the Death Gods, still only see the original lifespans.</comment><comment Id="16981" ParentId="13487">Depends on which version you're talking about, the US Dubbed version had episodes from the original Japanese version cut out and others reworked to make it less plot intensive, also major elements were reworked, Ziocite is a guy, Michiru and Haruka are cousins, the theme of Sacrifice/Death is greatly watered down in the Death Busters Arc. it's probably safe to say the US Dubbed version varies greatly because it varies from the original Japanese version</comment><comment Id="16982" ParentId="13487">I think that Sailor Moon Crystal is aiming to follow the manga story more, but I'm not sure about the original series</comment><comment Id="16985" ParentId="13487">@Memor-X: edited the question to clarify what I'm asking.</comment><comment Id="16988" ParentId="13487">In the original, the only difference i know of is that Hataru's body was more damaged so she's more machine in the Manga. originally i thought the anime followed the manga faithfully however when i learned that Crystal was doing that i just looked up the Death Busters Arc to see if Michiru and Haruka remained as lovers in the manga (they apparently do)</comment><comment Id="17158" ParentId="13556">Do you remember anything about the story? i.e. How did the girl survive/live in the fantasy world?</comment><comment Id="17165" ParentId="13558">I am quite sure Maria and Mamoru have a child together, and then Squealer somehow kills Maria and Mamoru and give their bones to the Council.

I would say this is because whatever stimuli that the diclonius emit that is used for sensing each other, is severely lowered in her Nyu state.

Many works of Western literature, including the dystopian works *1984* and *The Handmaid's Tale*, leave the ending up in the air; this isn't peculiar to Japanese works. It would be more accurate to say that those whose expectations are adapted to popular works with a clear ending, regardless of culture, have trouble coping with the lack of closure of certain kinds of literary, avant-garde works such as Eva.</comment><comment Id="27836" ParentId="20560">@Torisuda sorry if it seemed biased against Japanese works.

That is pretty much true for popular works, but Eva is more of an art house work, so I felt we should compare it with fine literature and more art house-type films like *Children of Men* (highly ambiguous ending, by the way) rather than popular works like, say, *Harry Potter* or *Return of the Jedi*.

Just what I was looking for, thanks.</comment><comment Id="28765" ParentId="5218">I am voting this answer down because it is not entirely accurate. While the Seven Deadly Sins figure as a literary theme, it is not the case that their origin is Western. The origin dates from [before the East/West schism in Christianity and involves Eastern church fathers](http://www.orthodoxchristianity.net/forum/index.php?topic=22364.0). Furthermore, the Bible originates from the Middle East, which is not part of the West.</comment><comment Id="28766" ParentId="5218">There is wide variation among the strains of Christianity (i.e. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Protestantism&#8217;s many branches, indigenous Christianities), [not all of which recognize a set of Seven Deadly Sins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_sin#Eastern_Christian_views) so the theme is not "universally recognizable" (the phrase &#8220;World Christianities&#8221; is used to describe this diversification). Despite respective intentions to derive their doctrines from the same source material (the Bible), in reality, Christian groups are marked by dramatic disparity.</comment><comment Id="28767" ParentId="5218">An additional factor which should be considered when considering use of Seven Deadly Sins in anime is that in Japanese language the word used to translate the Greek word for "sin" is &#12300;&#32618;&#12301;(tsumi), which commonly refers to crimes. The average Japanese person does not have a conceptualization of a sin that is not criminal/against the law/severe. Thus, the more globally-recognized definition of "sin" as something that one could do which is mild in its effects (sloth, tell a 'white lie,' shove your brother) or internal (lust, greed, pride) is not "universally recognizable" to the Japanese.</comment><comment Id="28768" ParentId="5218">@seijitsu you should post an answer...</comment><comment Id="28769" ParentId="5218">also, in response... okay, not *everyone* in japan is gonna know about the seven deadly sins. However, anyone that *writes stuff* for a living is probably gonna have gone through some sort of writing comp class, in which themes are introduced, and the chances are pretty good they're gonna learn about the seven deadly sins. In summary, you make really good points, but you missed the point of my answer completely.</comment><comment Id="28791" ParentId="20502">Can you tell us the convention? Also, random guess, but "All Purpose Cultural Cat-Girl Nuku Nuku"?</comment><comment Id="28841" ParentId="5218">@ton.yeung, no, Japanese schools do _not_ generally include a writing composition class, and even if they did, to simply claim that "the chances are pretty good they're gonna learn about the seven deadly sins" in such a class sounds like a stretch. I teach in the English department in a high-ranked Japanese university and am in a PhD program in another, but I have not heard of such a course offering.</comment><comment Id="28843" ParentId="5218">It is not tenable that "anyone that _writes stuff_ for a living" in Japan would likely have taken a composition class. 1) Mangaka is a career which allows young people to break in on artistic &amp; storytelling talent without required education or degrees. 2) Many mangaka majored in unrelated subjects (i.e., _Sailor Moon_'s Takeuchi Naoko is a pharmacist who majored in Chemistry) &amp; General Education in Japan is not like U.S. Gen Ed or U.K. A Levels. 3) Aspiring anime directors will more likely enroll in Anime Manga Seiyuu _senmongakkou_ (technical school) than a 4-year university that's got Gen Ed</comment><comment Id="28849" ParentId="5218">So what you're saying is that in japan, someone with a desire to write for a living will not find information on how to write effectively and efficiently?</comment><comment Id="28854" ParentId="21275">You have demonstrated your passion for writing and sharing your knowledge.

Normally, a person would take such a request to imply that you wanted to hear more than what I had already written in the comments section of your answer.</comment><comment Id="28872" ParentId="5218">@ton.yeung, no, I did not state that. What I said was that mangaka, anime directors, and even other Japanese writers 1) would not likely have taken a writing composition class (it is not customary in the Japanese education system), and 2) would not likely have learned of the Seven Deadly Sins in such a class. There are plenty of other ways a Japanese writer could learn how to hone his/her craft. It sounds sadly mistaken and colonialist to presume that a writing comp class in the Western style is the only, or even preferred way, to obtain/increase writing skills. Their work impresses us w/o it.</comment><comment Id="29894" ParentId="21275">@ton.yeung While I can understand that sometimes a detailed answer can be a bit *too* detailed, one must not discount an answer for length alone.

See this answer: http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20151/why-is-everyone-affected-by-infinite-tsukuyomi/20152#20152 Therefore eyes aren't the essential step to trapping people into the genjutsu.</comment><comment Id="35319" ParentId="24449">And Minato was able to share, like you mentioned, *the Nine Tails' chakra*.

It seems like Hans is likely to be a fake based on the story clues while Chamot is possibly a fake, but highly unlikely.</comment><comment Id="35408" ParentId="24502">Usually in this kind of series, the one that is most unlikely is the one that is fake. Remember Ichimaru Gin from Bleach and Enoshima Junko from Danganronpa? Gin is actually aiming to kill Aizen (the main evil) while Junko who was presumably dead, actually faked her death and is the main antagonist. Using the same logic, Hans might actually be a real brave.</comment><comment Id="35409" ParentId="24502">@SakuraiTomoko Hmm who are the most unlikely people? Adlet and Maura?</comment><comment Id="35411" ParentId="24502">I'd say Adlet is out since he is the main protagonist and his background story has already been laid out. Gin and Junko didn't have his background story laid out until near the end. I personally suspected Maura, though I have no proof whatsoever.</comment><comment Id="35444" ParentId="24530">This is it! I can't believe it! Wealth and glory to you! Thank you! I would have never figured out that "Delpower" was supposed to be one word.</comment><comment Id="35472" ParentId="24502">I'd say Adlet is in the mix specifically *because* he's the main protagonist; he's the only one with any real 'plot asymmetry', any meta-reason that it should be him and not someone else. He also seems to have gotten 'demon-touched' quite distinctly while in jail in the first episode. This is not to suggest that Adlet _knows_ he's the fake, but he's still my leading candidate for actually being the fake (though caveat: I'm presently an ep behind).</comment><comment Id="35489" ParentId="24502">I would go with Maura. Everyone is trying to find out how could someone get in without breaking the seal, but everyone is ignoring that Maura has the key... Sorry, I don't have enough points to add as a comment...</comment><comment Id="35494" ParentId="24502">My guess for the fake would be Nachetanya. Since Adlet is the main char I'm sure he can't be the fake. Hans is equal to Adlet in terms of skill, so he would make a suitable hero himself. then there's Maura and Chamot, Since Chamot is the strongest Saint she seems a legit hero and with Maura overseeing her, she must have alot of skill herself since Chamot respects her enough to obey her. Flamie has been nothing but honest so far and her skill seems pretty high. That just leaves goldof and Nachetanya for me. Nahctanya herself said Goldov is stronger than her tho.. so that leaves her as the fake.</comment><comment Id="35502" ParentId="24502">@ChenOrihara Also recall that Nachetanya was trying to protect Adlet. Assuming that the fake's goal is to kill multiple braves, she wouldn't want Adlet to die alone, or else it will prove he wasn't a fake after he died :) I'm applying this same reasoning to Hans, which indicates he is potentially a fake.</comment><comment Id="35522" ParentId="24502">You have to cite an episode in order to limit the scope of the question. otherwise, since this is an airing series, the possible answers could change in validity.</comment><comment Id="35523" ParentId="24502">@Mindwin Citing an episode might possibly be spoiling the series, which I have been trying to avoid.

You also say that she is everywhere in the universe because of her wish, but her wish only asked to erase witches before they're born. Witches aren't everywhere 24/7.

The only thing we know is that Tgurneu created the crest from the Saint's powers and Adlet is a fake. But it would be safe to assume that since it is still a fake crest, a petal would not disappear. However, your question is whether Hans is fake and I think I have fully answered that by proving he is a real Brave.</comment><comment Id="36223" ParentId="25986">@JoeW I don't really know much about Naruto (the show), but the answers to the linked question don't appear to say anything about Naruto (the character). Perhaps the answer is implicitly there if you know stuff about the show, but if it is, it's at least not obvious to me.</comment><comment Id="36225" ParentId="25986">@senshin In this case the answer relates to the first episode or first release of the Manga where Naruto first fails then passes the test. He was given a test to create multiple clones which he failed to do and it is implied that the test is not always the same. Also at this time it is not known how massive his chakra reserve is and it is only later after he learns the shadow clone technique and resolves the situation he was place in does he pass. The linked question explains how the test to graduate is not the same for everyone.</comment><comment Id="36246" ParentId="26010">I read the novels and I don't see where it says Adlet is a fake brave. Wiki says it right at the top of Adlet's page, but then gives no more information regarding that matter. I guess I'm looking for more of an explanation about how Adlet is fake because nothing has indicated that yet.</comment><comment Id="36252" ParentId="25986">I want to make one thing clear, Lee could not use Genjutsu and Ninjutsu , it is not chakra that he can't use, and what are those 3 techniques you are talking about, for lee exam was different , related to Taijutsu , about Taijutsu exam i don't have proof , i think it was not shown.But it should be Taijutsu related exam</comment><comment Id="36255" ParentId="26010">Then maybe it would be more adequate to modify your question to whether Adlet is the fake Brave or ask a new question about Adlet since right now you are asking about Hans.</comment><comment Id="36296" ParentId="25986">Naruto was disliked by almost all ninja in the village. Lee was not. This causes me to believe that (most of) the examiners were anxious to flunk Naruto and drive him away from the village. Lee may have been given an exam test that allowed him to use his Taijutsu or simply answer with basic academy knowledge on an oral test. It makes a difference if your faculty actively dislike you versus they are indifferent. I don't believe we have any in universe answer so any theory is as good as another.</comment><comment Id="36368" ParentId="26105">I'm not entirely sure, but I can tell you that KyoAni fairly extensively restructured and reworked the content of the light novels, as they tend to do with their light novel adaptations.

Not resurrected in a literal sense, but brought into the story suitably aged.

The illusionary world is trying to prevent the deaths of nagisa and ushio, but why? Also how does Ushio know they will die and know to save them? Is the missing piece here that they died once, and time reset after that, to let it play through again just to save them? The anime only went through 1 time, so it seemed like they were trying to be saved before it was ever known or seen what would happen to them.</comment><comment Id="36574" ParentId="24277">This answer would need an update, as the answer doesn't exactly reply to the question.

To me it seems very suspicious that a British looking person would have a Japanese name</comment><comment Id="37103" ParentId="26614">@BCLC i suspect L had the same thought as Light's monologue. he already concluded that Kira needs a name and face so even with L's face had Light tried to test his name out the real Ryuga may have died and that would not only limit the number of potential suspects but increase his own suspicion of Light. he could have probably used a British star but probably wanted someone Light would know already</comment><comment Id="37109" ParentId="26010">Okay I'm currently caught up with the latest volume. Both supporting claims from your answer are wrong. It seems like the Wiki contains misleading information.

Thus, there is no point in proving that Adlet is real since there are still other braves that may be fake. Therefore, I believe the answer to your question is not about proving Adlet's innocence, but instead Hans's.</comment><comment Id="37115" ParentId="26614">@Maroon Japanese because it's an anime, I get that. Just liked in dubbed anime everyone speaks English. But in-universe, there has to be some explanation. Haven't seen f/z or f/sn yet, but I'm guessing in-universe, Waver was either speaking English or knows some Japanese...right?</comment><comment Id="37119" ParentId="26614">@BCLC: I'm actually not sure---I mostly know of that detail because I heard about a drama CD where his lack of proficiency comes up. There are always interesting problems in anime with overtly "multicultural" settings though (e.g. here, or in Black Lagoon), where from the voice-acting it's hard to tell what language is actually being used.</comment><comment Id="37129" ParentId="26614">@BCLC You are looking **way too much** into this. When you see a hollywood movie featuring foreigners, they speak English with a foreign accent (on purpose), but you never question where they had learned English from. Sometimes you let them speak a foreign language to make it sound cooler, but in comics you don't have subtitles. I mean, heck the American president in Death Note was speaking Japanese, which he obviously isn't capable of, but imagine how weird it would be if Ohba would write whole chapters in English. Do you think his audience would like that?</comment><comment Id="37130" ParentId="26614">@PeterRaeves I dont expect those parts to be in English. Obviously he did speak English. I guess we'll never know what language Light and L spoke to each other. Some important parts I guess however would be the degree of fluency of Japanese of L. When L is listening to the Yotsuba conversation, does he understand? If there is no indication of language difficulty, it seems that he is fluent in Japanese. Is he? Can't find any official source. Anyway, how about the DN 2015 series? You would be fine with lind l tailor speaking or raye penber and bell conversing in Jap when they look western?</comment><comment Id="37131" ParentId="26614">@PeterRaeves also what about the SPK? Do they know Japanese? When Light makes his speech at the end, is it in English for the sake of the Western people in the room?</comment><comment Id="37136" ParentId="26614">@BCLC Why does it even matter? Obviously in a real setting they would have language barriers. The SPK would not understand Japanese, neither would L. Japanese is not part of any country's curriculum, while Japan on the other hand, has English in its curriculum, so Light would be able to fluently speak English, being the genius that he is. So Japanese people would speak Japanese among themselves and Light would speak English to L, N and M and then translate it to the others.</comment><comment Id="37138" ParentId="26614">@BCLC "Would you be fine to see a westerner speaking Japanese?"

Changes to the original question invalidate current answers, that's why I recommended asking a new question.</comment><comment Id="39845" ParentId="28259">It has nothing to do with Japanese language</comment><comment Id="39883" ParentId="28260">@Jen As krazr has mentioned elsewhere it's pretty broad and both context and artist dependant. Some artists use bars and vary on the styles/sizes used. The thing is, censorship is often hard to enforce with many artists being self-published, and the rules are vague enough as is, so there's no exact minimum - artists just try their luck.

This seems kind of a weird anime if its basis for some twists is in rules that are made up along the way or stated midway. It also seems kind of unfair for the contestants. Assuming none of them is the mastermind behind the game, Monokuma could make up rules that would be intentionally or accidentally biased or unfair eg flip a coin in the case of a drawn vote.

The whole story is not made for the spectator to try and follow the logic of the players and all, but to make the spectator fell totally at lost along with the main character.</comment><comment Id="41009" ParentId="29331">@Sigfried666 so the entire franchise is filled with plot holes? No one in the entire school wonders what happens if murderers would continue getting caught until they are down to three players? Or maybe everyone thinks it is too unlikely to happen or that monokuma will just fill them in later? If I were in the game I wouldn't just wait for monokuma to continue making up rules. I want them stated early on. It's my neck on the line if I don't ask. For all I know monokuma's going to randomly pick between the remaining three.

Perhaps some of your ideas might even appear on it. Considering that "purpose" of the game Monokuma forces the players to participate in, I think the "making up rules as they become needed" is part of his proccedings, as frustrating as it sounds.

If the enzymes are structured so that regular human food turns into something bad for the body's cells, it will taste disgusting and the body will reject it (vomiting reflex).

If they are just ordinary punches and kicks, then these jutsus must be present and used in all the 8 gates since each gate give you a certain amount of power instead of only the 8th gate. I think this is a serious plot hole in the series.</comment><comment Id="47208" ParentId="34261">@Bej each gate powers you up. Just because you can throw a punch does not mean you can throw it fast enough to light it on fire due to friction. They also are not equivalent since you did not know. The first gate only removes the brains restraint on the muscles. no other gate can do that. every gate is completely unique and offers a significant power boost. so significant in fact that guy did not have the power necessary to perform such maneuvers on lower gates. Guy never gets visibly stronger in the series, just opens more gates.</comment><comment Id="47210" ParentId="34261">@jNat Derived jutsu only mean that the parent was used in some way to perform the Derived Jutsu. RasenShuriken is a rasengan, but jutsu like Shadow clone have no direct parent, despite Obviously being a Clone Jutsu. The gates are inbetween, its not that the Jutsu are special or unique, but rather that the strength and speed required to use them is impossible without the gates. No one but Guy lights their own fists on fire due to shear friction, because the speed required is so great that only guy with 6 gates can do it. "punches are so fast, they are set ablaze by sheer speed and friction"wiki</comment><comment Id="47211" ParentId="34261">@JNat Its the same with all the other descriptions on The wiki itself. Morning Peacock is just a Taijutsu combo of a upward kick, then many super high speed punches. Such jutus only exist because of the eight gates, but to learn how to do them, you need only know how to do the basic taijustsu combination, Sasukes Lions barage first kick followed by a simple 1-2 punch combo. If you want to light your fists on fire however,  you need speed only Guy has ever shown. no one else has ever been that fast without cheating via teleportation.</comment><comment Id="47244" ParentId="34310">Ok so magazines are a publisher of manga but they are also different from studios.

In the latter episodes, the last animated arc, Ikkaku is fighting and notes that he was just standing, despite being in the air. Could simply be that the cost to stand in air in high reshi environments is too costly to be efficient, at least until you get very powerful, which i do believe is shown in the manga only right now.

I'll see if anyone gives a better explanation or else i'll assign this answer as correct answer. Thanks for your effect by the way. Cheers</comment><comment Id="47658" ParentId="34556">The Uchiha don't have Hiden techniques, all of their techniques are Kekkei Genkai. Genjutsu: Sharingan, Kamui (an ability specific to the Mangekyo Sharingan), Izanami, Izanagi, and other Sharingan-specific jutsu are usable only by someone with a Sharingan. For a technique to be true Hiden, it must be **usable** by anyone, without anything more than training.</comment><comment Id="47659" ParentId="34556">Notice most Hidden Jutsu are actually just Yin and/or Yang based, because everyone has those. Kekkei Genkai on the other hand are always either the ability to combine 2 elements, or a special organ. For chakra fusions, that is permanent, but the special organs can sometimes be transplanted, especially the eyes, to grant other users similar powers, though frequently at a greater cost. That however is not teachable.</comment><comment Id="47668" ParentId="34556">@RFKomos Does that mean anyone with Sharingan can use Izanagi/Izanami other Sharingan techniques. Sharingan allows them to predict their opponents moves and cast basic genjutsus. Other techniques need to be taught or discovered.</comment><comment Id="47669" ParentId="34556">@Ryan Agreed. But I am not talking about Kekkei Genkai ONLY. I am saying some jutsu's exist which can only be taught if the user has that specific organ. Instead of Gentle Fist, take Kakashi's Chidori. He created as a youngster, but it only became complete once he got the sharingan. Sasuke took it further. If an Uchiha had discovered Chidori and then passed it along his generation it might have been a Hiden Jutsu.</comment><comment Id="47674" ParentId="34556">Is there any instance of Yin-Yang release type Hiden Jutsu being performed by people outside their clan?</comment><comment Id="47680" ParentId="34556">@Arcane Yes, we saw this with Danzo using Izanagi. Chidori and Raikiri are both neither kekkei genkai nor hiden. They're techniques with drawbacks that become more powerful paired with a Sharingan. Theoretically, anyone can learn Gentle Fist style. But it would be pretty useless because you'd be blindly hoping you're striking chakra nodes, making it horribly ineffective. The only people it's **effective** for are Byakugan users, which is why only Hyuuga use it. Because only Hyuuga use it, only Hyuuga know it, making it Hiden.</comment><comment Id="47681" ParentId="35574">First time DB airs was in the 90s where pedophilia issue was not as rampant as now. Because of that, maybe at that time they wasn't thinking that the nudity needs to be censored.</comment><comment Id="47683" ParentId="34556">@RFKomos Sort of my point. Chidori is ineffective without the sharingan and it could've turned to Hiden in a similar manner as that of Gentle Fist. For Example. Ao doesn't use gentle Fist even with his Byakugan</comment><comment Id="47684" ParentId="35574">Japan is a different culture from the US and Europe, nudity wasn't considered so sexual as it was elsewhere at the time.</comment><comment Id="47685" ParentId="35574">FCC and other networking standards were still in their infancy back then.

DB was after-all one of the first anime seen by most Americans.</comment><comment Id="47689" ParentId="34556">@Arcane It's not "ineffective" without the Sharingan. It's just that the Sharingan takes away the weakness of the Chidori/Raikiri. Naruto's Rasengan uses the exact same principle (punch someone with a ball of chakra) and it's very effective, as an example. Any jutsu "could" have gone Hiden, that's a pretty irrelevant point.</comment><comment Id="47690" ParentId="34534">For reviewers: please consider that this question could have been on Movies.SE asking about why "grim and gritty" cartoons are getting popular.

Kakshi almost died without the sharingan simply because he could not counter an attack while using his chidori he normally would have dodged. Minato saved him that time, but once he got his sharingan, he could follow and predict everyones movements, so not getting hit was easy again while using it.</comment><comment Id="47716" ParentId="34556">I was asking about instances of Nara and Akimichi clan's Hiden Jutsu being used outside their clan.

There definitely are academics in the West studying recent, relatively niche works of pure entertainment like comic books and YA novels.

More than a few times, I've been on the fence about a show, and when I start writing an analysis I'll either realize that it was a lot deeper than I thought at first, and appreciate it more, or see that it was really pretty shallow.

About the question though, it is kinda clear that the asker is under the perception that the sword was never used. Read the last line for this. And I think the second one provides a much better and accurate answer which clears the doubt about Excalibur being used or not. This answer although states a fact right from the Wikia but says nothing about it being used or not. Reading it kind of implies the sword was never used. Just a bit confusing I would say.

Guess what happens in episdoe 21, he used it for the gain of Yuuki, and not himself.</comment><comment Id="48545" ParentId="36083">@Hakase There is not much in the Manga/Anime as such. I was wondering if someone remembers something Kishi himself said about the economics of Ninja village in a talk/databook i.e. other official sources</comment><comment Id="48560" ParentId="36007">@Ryan The question never asked for whether he uses it for personal gain or not. It only asked whether the sword was used at all after he obtained. The answer doesn't provide the fact whether it was used or not. It only tells that Kirito resolved to not use it for his own personal gain. That's not the answer.</comment><comment Id="48572" ParentId="36007">@BlackKnigh7 You do see that the answer was edited to include the part where he does use it right? It currently gives the reasons why he does not always use it, and also gives the one example where he did, which is better than he used it once, but then arbitrarily decided not to do so at other times.</comment><comment Id="48604" ParentId="36007">@Ryan You do see that I started advocating for the other answer before there was any such description in this one, right? Yes he edited the answer and now does mention that he used the sword so the answer can be accepted to be correct. That's all I was talking about. Accepting a correct answer. It was not a complete answer before this.</comment><comment Id="48611" ParentId="36007">@BlackKnigh7 yes I did, but that is not an excuse for replying long after the edit, saying that the content the edit added is not there. This also does not excuse changing the subject and attacking my comment. The answer before the edit had far more value than you gave it credit for, but if you want to discuss any of this, you need to find somewhere else to do it than here and hope im interested.</comment><comment Id="48616" ParentId="36007">@Ryan That long after it was edited? It was edited roughly yesterday. I was ready to close the topic but about the answer, the second answer clearly stated the sword was used. The first answer before it was edited said he resolved to never use it for personal gain. How is that better than an answer that clears the asker's wrong perception that the sword was indeed used and also provides a proof. I am not changing the subject. I am simply stating why I was supporting the second answer.</comment><comment Id="48617" ParentId="36007">@BlackKnigh7 So then, why is it that hours after the edit, you talking about the answer in the present tense, but then completely ignore the edit? Ya, before the edit, your reply made sense, but after the edit, your attacking my comment using evidence that no longer exists. Since i only replied after the edit to begin with, Your reply was changing the subject from present to past, and when i brought that up, you admitted to it. All because i was trying to show you what you clearly did not understand about the original answer which was unrelated to it being acceptable or not.</comment><comment Id="48620" ParentId="36007">@Ryan Your saying me attacking your comment doesn't actually make it true you know. And yes, if someone were to change the answer I was talking about, obviously my previous comments would seem to make less sense. I don't want to keep at this anymore but I can see how you are deliberately trying to prove me wrong and not acknowledging the fact that the other answer made more sense which was why I brought this up in the first place. I mean you are not even talking about the two answers anymore.</comment><comment Id="48621" ParentId="36007">@BlackKnigh7 So you are trying to debate which answer is better. Fine, Ill bite. This answer is better, both before and after the edit. Before, It explains why Kirito was so reserved about using it, and after, it shows that he did use it, and even explains why he only used it once. Op clearly wanted to know why kirito did not make it one of his main weapons, and this answer addresses that, even before the edit, while the other does not. Even though it could use another edit to expand on the time he did use it, This one always answered the question far better.</comment><comment Id="48622" ParentId="36007">@Ryan So is it going to be an illogical debate now? You're going to say it's right just because you said it once? And you're all aggravated now that I pointed that you were getting off topic. Please tell me did the answer tell that Kirito used the sword before the edit? It didn't. While the second answer did. It corrected the wrong perception that the sword wasn't used. Did this one do it before the edit? It didn't. That's all I said back then and that's all I am saying right now. But I don't want to be a part of an illogical debate. I shall say no more.</comment><comment Id="48696" ParentId="36183">How does this answer the question of why it became longer?</comment><comment Id="48697" ParentId="36183">I am trying to say, there was no "canonical" nor "production related" first, because the AKira says so. If you doubt my translation, please go to Japanese site.</comment><comment Id="48698" ParentId="36183">No one doubts your translation, but the question wasn't asking about the title or about the length relative to Dragon Ball; it was asking why events in the Dragon Ball Z anime seem to be dragged out longer than the same events were in the Dragon Ball Z manga.

No better assumptions, since there were no other ghouls of SSS rate other than Eto.</comment><comment Id="50287" ParentId="37109">@lentinant First off, the Ghoul can be dead, the Kagune Sac itself is all that is important, like most human organs, its still good after death, though how long is uncertain since its not human. Second, It cant be from Kaneki's fight against Eto, She did not leave any Kagune Sacs, just RC Cells. Third, Yoshimura is also SSS, and classified as OWL, Eto is One eyed Owl. Fourth, He did fight and win against at least one of them a long time ago, I believe Yoshimura references this when he fights Kurowa and Shinohara.</comment><comment Id="50290" ParentId="37109">@Ryan Yoshimura references, that he lost arm to Arima, not Kakuho. Still, all "material" from Yoshimura still belongs to Aogiri, at least at the moment, when Arima faces Kaneki.</comment><comment Id="50291" ParentId="37109">@Ryan, well, this Quinque may be done with part of actually Eto's kakuho. Kaneki was given part of Rize kakuho, and this part still works as fully functional kakuho. This means, that it is possible to take part of kakuho from ghoul without killing him (especially when we are talking about Eto, who has high regenerative abilities). Eto was imprisoned for long time in Cochlea, so it was possible for her to have operation meanwhile. Also, I can't believe she lost so easily to Fuwa, which makes me think she was weakened. But this is also completely my imagination without any proofs.</comment><comment Id="50292" ParentId="37109">@lentinant Dont forget Ghouls can have more than one Kakuho. Jason had at least 2, Kaneki Ate one, but he had another which he used on Juzo before being killed.  Yoshimura and Eto have 6-8 according to the Wiki, and Shinohara noted Centipede had several. They of course regenerate as well, which is how they are farmed. I also highly doubt ghouls in Cochila are fed until they are full. Eto was likely Very hungry and weak when she fought Furuta.</comment><comment Id="50354" ParentId="2072">@ryan Isn't it also said in the anime/manga that Rock Lee is a genius at hard work?</comment><comment Id="50355" ParentId="37163">Note: the intact scissors verse half scissors is likely relevant.

His confidence directly caused him to drop his defenses, and that is what left him vulnerable to the attack. Without his defenses up, he has only his raw body strength to resist the attack, and though we all know he could easily take bullets with that body, it cant deal with any Ki attacks.</comment><comment Id="50736" ParentId="37371">When was it established that you need SSJ1 to be nearly your normal state to achieve SSJ2. Vegeta was not able to do so when he went Majin and attained SSJ2. Goku and Gohan trained to maintain SSJ1 for longer periods of time so that they could conserve energy for the fight against cell. Goku was at the same level as Gohan regarding SSJ1 feeling normal, but he was no where near being able to go SSJ2, while Gohan was.</comment><comment Id="50738" ParentId="37371">Until the first SSJ2 transformation, NO ONE went from normal to SSJ2.

"Can a transformed saiyan lower his ki to base-human level when transformed?" I answered the original question, you added stuff about not needing to be SSJ1.

You say ssj needs to feel like a normal state for ssj2. But that's not actually the case. As stated in the wiki here. http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_2 In order to reach ssj2 you need to have a large amount of energy way beyond what is needed for ssj.</comment><comment Id="50749" ParentId="37371">I had to edit my answer, since it seems to be such a big deal, more so than the question itself. I'm done talking about this topic, it has exceeded my entertainment time for today. Bottom line, they DID lower their power while in SSJ form.

The main point of my answer was that large ships like battleships were simply not mobile enough to be worth deploying without an escort of smaller ships because they could easily be sunk by torpedoes. Certainly the battleships were not particularly effective in combat compared to carriers, but they'd have fared even worse in a fleet without smaller ships escorting them...</comment><comment Id="50899" ParentId="19374">That said, WWII-era battleships probably would have been more effective at bombardment of enemy settlements, but this was not especially relevant and in high-seas combat they were simply not a match for carriers.</comment><comment Id="50900" ParentId="19374">Yeah, I kinda misread some of your post lol.

It's also apparently common for parents to send their children to expensive private middle schools and high schools.</comment><comment Id="51951" ParentId="38206">In the USA school spending in most states is supported locally.  So some schools can barely afford books for the students, while others can give each student a computer.  I'm sure we have some very fancy public schools, but the current political anti-tax climate is probably starting to strangle even affluent districts.</comment><comment Id="51969" ParentId="37881">how come its surplus? "The way that a Quincy destroys a Hollow would prevent their soul from ever re-entering the cycle". From wiki, "Quincy completely extinguish Hollows, thus the souls that come to the Human World do not return to Soul Society and therefore the souls would increase only on the side of the Human World." Thus, 28000 souls should be in Soul Society, but instead just come back to Human World. This means Soul Society is missing 28000 souls and Mayuri killed 28000 more souls in Soul Society, so human world has 56000 more souls than SS. Mayuri should have killed humans instead.</comment><comment Id="51970" ParentId="37881">maybe you can illustrate in Ms Paint on your free time? lol</comment><comment Id="51971" ParentId="38206">The school in _Tanaka-kun_ is heavily modelled after Motomachi High School in Hiroshima, which is just about as fancy.

Hiroshima Castle (not the original; a replica was built after the atomic bombing) is just across a moat from Motomachi HS.</comment><comment Id="51972" ParentId="38206">It's worth noting that the adult:child ratio is high and growing faster in Japan than probably anywhere else, which (combined with Japan being one of the wealthiest nations in the world) I would imagine means relatively more tax dollars for education per child in Japan than in most places.

I recall someone also said Edo Tensei Rinnegan were fake Rinnegan which could not summon the Gedo Mazo. Also, its likely that, like all other damage done to Edo Tensei bodies, the eyes would crumble to paper like scraps and then try to remerge with the body, or remain useless and new eyes would form.</comment><comment Id="52461" ParentId="2024">Madara lost his eyes when he was revived with the Rinne Tensei, he had his Rinnegan when he was revived by Edo Tensei. Those are two different jutsus. The Edo Tensei Rinnegan could not be used to cast the Rinne Tensei, that is why Madara needed to use the real Rinnegan (which was with Tobi at the time).</comment><comment Id="52462" ParentId="2024">That said though, Kishimito-sama seemed to have hurried through the final battle at times, and was not always consistent. For instance, Madara somehow summoned Susannoo *without eyes* at one point even though it was explicitly stated earlier that it required Mangekyou Sharingan in both eyes.</comment><comment Id="52463" ParentId="2024">It was originally stated by itachi that when you master the Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, you get Susanoo, but Sasuke, Madara, and Kakashi do not have both of those techniques, but got Susanoo. It was kind of changed to be more related to mastery of the technique each eye gives you, but then, that implies that only mastery is required, and having the eye or not becomes irrelevant after that. It is strange though.</comment><comment Id="52464" ParentId="2024">the Susanoo Wiki entry "The third databook states that the user must first unlock Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu before they can gain Susanoo,[1] though this was only the case for Itachi. In the fourth databook, acquiring this technique is done through the user manifesting both Mangeky&#333; Sharingan." Seems to support that idea. Manifesting both Mangekyou  is how you acquire the technique, but not a requirement for using it afterwards.</comment><comment Id="52465" ParentId="2024">Actually, you need to activate Mangekyou in both the eyes to be able to use Susanoo, those techniques need not be Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi. Itachi's Mangekyou gave him those abilities, so he may have been referring only to himself. That was also why Kakashi could use Susanoo after Obito "gifted" him both the Sharingans (which is another strange development by itself). In Obito/Kakashi's case, the Mangekyou powers happened to be the long-range Kamui and short-range Kamui. Sasuke did activate Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi as his Mangekyou powers, and we don't know what Madara's Mangekyou powers were.</comment><comment Id="52467" ParentId="2024">Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52384/discussion-between-masked-man-and-ryan).</comment><comment Id="52578" ParentId="17329">One IMHO important side arc left out is about Ilse's Journal, though there _is_ [a separate OVA](http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/Ilse%27s_Notebook:_Record_of_a_Fallen_Soldier) of that.</comment><comment Id="52589" ParentId="36744">I'm not sure if it's official, but I also found some things between Tales of Zestiria and Berseria.

And in Berseria, you also have spirits but more people can see them and more than that you have those spirits called 'Minouz' which are in the two games.

Jugo's body has enzymes that are able to naturally absorb senjutsu chakra. Orochimaru mixed them with his knowledge of Senjutsu chakra to create the cursed seals. When the user activates them, the enzymes activate, absorbing nature energy, but like Jugo, they transform the user if enough is absorbed. Too much nature energy always transforms the user, but the enzymes never go way too far to where it becomes permanent. There is a price to pay for that though, but thats another question.</comment><comment Id="53260" ParentId="39180">Thanks for your answer. :-) So basically Ai _wants_ to be called "Haibara-san"?

And to be taken seriously, they had to drop the funny act. That's one thing that comes to my mind.</comment><comment Id="55428" ParentId="41039">The Simpsons is an animated prime time sitcom and is targeted not at adults specifically but at families. In this respect it's just like The Flintstones, another US animated prime time sitcom that originally aired in 60's. It's not really all that hard to find animated TV series in Japan, that are very popular, comedies and targeted at a broad family audience just like The Simpsons. Crayon Shin-Chan for example, is often compared to The Simpsons, because of the similarities between its titular character and Bart Simpson. Another example is the show that airs before it, Doraemon.</comment><comment Id="55429" ParentId="41039">Perhaps the only long running anime that's similar to Simpsons that I can think of is Sazae-san. I don't know if it's comedic enough since I don't watch it though, but I believe both are family-oriented as Ross mentioned (compared to Doraemon, which I believe is more children-oriented anime). On the other hand, I think I can safely say that long-running, family-oriented anime/cartoon tends to be comedic.. otherwise, there's no plot and no entertainment value.</comment><comment Id="55450" ParentId="40942">There's no way Gotenks Ssj3 can lose to base form Vegeta.

Goku in base form using god ki could defeat Freezer 4th form, when Gohan super saiyan was almost killed by Freezer 1st form. That's what we saw in Dragon Ball Super and Fukkatsu no F. Vegeta in base form using god ki is stronger than SSJ3 Gotenks, no surprise here, since using god ki makes you about equally stronger than Super Saiyan God (red) , and Super Saiyan God Red is stronger than Super Saiyan 3 by far. It's like if Vegeta Super Saiyan God (red) would be fighting SSJ3 Gotenks</comment><comment Id="55463" ParentId="15042">"Or will she get the lifespan from Mr. X?"

In the Manga, Goku Mastered Blue, meaning its stamina drain was cut down to almost nil, but we have not seen him purposefully suppress the SSJ3 aura, meaning he probably hasn't mastered it. By that standard, SSJ3 consumes more stamina than Blue does for Manga Goku (as of the Zamasu arc end). If the anime is even somewhat doing the same thing even indirectly, we could probably assume Red consumes less stamina than SSJ3 to maintain, but is way stronger with the God Ki</comment><comment Id="56618" ParentId="41927">@Ryan interesting comment, post it as an answer and I'll vote it up</comment><comment Id="56697" ParentId="42006">The &#35468; in &#21516;&#20154;&#35468; refers to periodic publication.</comment><comment Id="56731" ParentId="42045">This isn't limited to anime.

The skill would be self-movement which Goku has mastered and even Beerus hasn't mastered the same.</comment><comment Id="58182" ParentId="43375">According to Whis Ultra Instinct is when the body responds to an action without the brain having to process the action. This simply eleminates a process, which makes it a state and not a transformation. Whis also said that Goku used Ultra Instinct. Being able to use something doesn't mean that you have mastered it. For example I can write english sentences, but I haven't mastered the english language.</comment><comment Id="58188" ParentId="43375">Firstly, Whis has described the technique as self-movement while training Goku and Vegeta. He also states that this technique is incredibly hard to master and even Lord Beerus hasn't mastered it yet. When Beerus utilises the technique, we see that it's not perfect in tha manga. As for Whis, we see him utilizing it in his natural state where he is conscious of what is going on.(Even Beerus was in his natural state). Goku has also mastered the technique like Whis, however, he isn't conscious while utilising the same based on the fact that he didn't know what happened the first time he used it.</comment><comment Id="58189" ParentId="43375">Also, Goku needs a transformation to attain that state. If it was a regular skill, he would be utilizing it in his SSJB form or in all of his transformations. However, he undergoes a unique transformation while utilizing this state which he hasn't mastered yet. So in other words, Goku has mastered self-movement as we have seen an unmastered version of the same being used by Beerus in the manga. What he hasn't mastered is the transformation(Possibly just him or maybe Saiyans in general require), to attain that state.</comment><comment Id="58190" ParentId="43375">Alright I understand the differences from both our point of views, so let's agree to disagree. But back to the main question, your comments basically indicate that Beerus is able to use Ultra Instinct, which answers my question. I didn't ask if he had mastered it. In the anime we didn't know yet that he was even capable of using it, let alone mastering it.</comment><comment Id="58192" ParentId="43375">What I'm trying to say is Ultra Instinct is a transformation and Self-Movement is the technique, Beerus cannot use the transformation. Goku uses a transformation as it clearly acts as a power multiplier or he wouldn't be able to take JIren's attacks in his base form. Goku has mastered the skill of self-movement. The gods all can utilise the skill but not to the same level as Goku while he uses it in his UI transformation.</comment><comment Id="58193" ParentId="43370">true, I didnt remember this</comment><comment Id="58237" ParentId="42163">you could mark the answer as "accepted answer" if the answer helpful you know...</comment><comment Id="58300" ParentId="43416">Yes this is true .

He didn't have the Bang on his forehead which he always does. He was using his base form plus Gohan's Ultimate form is a lot different from that in the Z saga. He's a lot stronger.

He had to at least have lived another 20-30 years (for his son or daughter to get old enough and get married and bear children) and then a few years of Tsunade's life thrown in as well.

It's a generic term for a commonplace depiction of a literary trope. The term in itself is self explanatory akin to being "red faced." Certain languages have better words to describe things than others. "Hot" in English can describe temperature or taste (i. e., spice) literally and figuratively. In Asian languages, there are specific words for temperature hot and spicy hot. When someone says something is hot, your can infer the meaning by its the context it was said. Similar circumstance here.</comment><comment Id="60211" ParentId="45087">That's totally spies!</comment><comment Id="60212" ParentId="46130">What I meant was "Where did you get it from?"

I can point you to wikis like [niconico encyclopedia](http://dic.nicovideo.jp/t/a/&#36196;&#38754;), but it will be the same as telling you to googling it (the answer.)

It MAY be that All for One can't steal it, but they only ever said in canon as far as I've read that it can't be stolen by stealing blood, hair, whatever from Izuku. It is definitely true though that after All Might passed on One for All, it could no longer be stolen from him.</comment><comment Id="61621" ParentId="47433">I also thought what @kaine said. That the logic of the user has to be willing to pass it to "passing it along by consuming DNA" doesnt apply to someone with a stealing quirk. I also think that for some reason (that might not be that one) All for One can't steal it anyway. May be it's related to that condition it's said online All for One said, that once he transfered a quirk after a while he can't recover it. Since he passed one of the quirks of One for All and time passed may be that's why he can't recover it.</comment><comment Id="61622" ParentId="47435">Also, can I say how terrible it is that he called the powers One for All and All for One?

I know that Minato had marked Bee, and he used that mark to teleported to Bee.

I'm not native speaker so my wording might be confusing.</comment><comment Id="63843" ParentId="49873">Can he appear to unmarked location using Body Flicker? And if so why Raikage didn't anticipate that as well? This is my question.</comment><comment Id="63844" ParentId="49876">ooh, alright now I get what you mean @Albert.  Its because of the rumors he's heard of about Minato using lots of kunais to easily move around. Since Minato spread his Kunais around, raikage was expecting him  to dodge easily with his famed "Flying Raijin" technique. Also, Raikage was at his top speed when he went after Minato, and he probably thought that the only way Minato could dodge his fastest mode attack was if he teleported away to the Kunais.</comment><comment Id="63860" ParentId="49898">(reply to deleted comment) It indeed is not clear, but if Minato's body flicker were comparable to A's, then Teleportation would have been a huge waste of chakra. No way Flying Raijin is not many times more expensive than a short body flicker. Minato threw dozens of Kunai and left them there when he retreated, realistically almost all the ones he had without summoning more. Its like Sasuke using 1 of his 2 chidori attacks per day during the chunin exams, extremely expensive, and a very bad idea in the middle of a warzone, unless you absolutely had to in order to ensure victory.</comment><comment Id="63922" ParentId="49936">If you haven't seen it already, [this listing](http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood) of firearms in FMA (which may be incomplete) strongly supports the "by design" reasoning.</comment><comment Id="64027" ParentId="50042">Thanks , i think it was another song, becouse lisa's song sound differently.thank you very much</comment><comment Id="65194" ParentId="50178">I can't check the episode right now, is it [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHr94DMMCk0) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0_p3X6-qME)?</comment><comment Id="65195" ParentId="50178">Nope, neither!

Based on your points I do realize that it can't be genetic/unique. If it was then indeed it wouldn't carry over in a fusion. As for the hair color in the movie, I strongly believe that this has more to do with the color palette than an actual meaning behind it. Yellow + blue = green. Vegeta uses god ki a lot now so I think as muscle memory that some inferred during his transformation which resulted in green for a brief moment. This is purely my opinion and no fact or so at all though. It also might be a hint towards future content.

In Pure Titans, Hange was never able to find a human residing in the nape, like with Titan Shifters. Only the Titan Shifters have humans in them in the nape. Please understand that I am talking about the Pure Titans that cannot transform and has no mind of their own, which is vastly different than Titan Shifters.</comment><comment Id="69387" ParentId="55397">@Jontia Eren is a Titan Shifter, not a Pure Titan so I don't see how this contradicts my answer. For reference, may I ask up to which chapter have you read in the manga? So that I can maybe avoid spoilers in case it's still not clear.</comment><comment Id="69388" ParentId="55397">I'm anime rather than manga. But the growth transformation doesn't seem to fit for either Shifters or Pure titans. Shifters obviously have the human body still present. If Pures were growth transformation, there's no reason for the nape/weakspot to be so small and specific.</comment><comment Id="69389" ParentId="55397">@Jontia Then, again, it was shown in the manga how Hange never found anything in the nape when they opened one. Check Chapter 51. It was speculated that there was something in there that is 'probably' a part of human that acts as control center for Pure Titans but it was never really clarified since the physiology of Pure Titans was never discussed that much. It was only up to speculation by Hange.</comment><comment Id="69390" ParentId="55397">The link in the question points at Chapter 51, it is something I will check out when I get a chance. But ultimately that is the root of the question. If the human body of a pure is gone, how do they get it back when eating a shifter? Titan Regeneration seems like a reasonable answer. Well as reasonable as people turning into Titans in the first place anyway...</comment><comment Id="69391" ParentId="55397">@Jontia That is something that is never answered in the manga, if I recall correctly. Which was why I presented a possible explanation, although I admit it is somewhat vague. Who knows, I could be wrong when new chapters explaining it would come out :)</comment><comment Id="69397" ParentId="55430">Welcome to the Animanga SE.

ODM gear can either be grappled unto: a Titan you are attacking or the surroundings (like trees, buildings and the like). In this case, it looks more like it's grappled somewhere on the Titan's upper part, either on the head, neck or shoulders. Or it could be attached to a tree at the back that is as tall as the Titan he's targeting.</comment><comment Id="69637" ParentId="55703">But in the pic the hand is in the bottom, or i think its a hand</comment><comment Id="69640" ParentId="55703">As I said, it could also be attached to a tree at the back that is as tall, or taller, as the Titan he's targeting.</comment><comment Id="69642" ParentId="55703">After rewatching this episode the only thing tall enough to grapple to is the tower. There are trees but they aren't thick enough to grab on to, and all of the thin ones are short. Mike is 6'6 or 6'5 but either way, he is one of the tallest/biggest characters so it would need to be a big tree to support his weight.</comment><comment Id="69687" ParentId="2552">strong beard dont grow on chins, they move to the upper levels.</comment><comment Id="69735" ParentId="55679">I also recommend to use spoiler tag since everything you've said is not yet showed in the anime.</comment><comment Id="69747" ParentId="2598">@hkBattousai  You can't expect him to come back and edit this answer.
