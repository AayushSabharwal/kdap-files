But still, when Inuyasha becomes a full demon he is the only one in series that losing control for no reason when he's transform.
For that matter you have the half-demon Naraku that is just like Inuyasha, and he became a full demon and still didn't become crazy at all.

It's true that some anime is repetitive and non-continuous, but the greatest difference I've found is that most western-made cartoons have no continuous plot, making them better-suited for children. (This also leads into the idea that western cartoons often incorporate some moral or lesson into each episode, but this is less apparent.)</comment><comment Id="1471" ParentId="81">@Dani I think continuity is related to the differences shows are broadcast and renewed. In Japan the success of a series is typically gauged on it's profitability, usually by it's disc sales, in the US, it's by viewership. In Western countries, they want a series to last as long as possible so they can build and sell stuff off the brand they built. Most animes, don't have a regularly allotted broadcast schedule that gets renewed every season (shows in the West get renewed if their ratings do well), so it would make sense to have a contiguous plot that (usually) wraps things ups.</comment><comment Id="1472" ParentId="81">@Dani you see a break in continuity with long-running series like Bleach and Naruto, with their filler episodes.</comment><comment Id="1476" ParentId="81">@Krazer Interesting point about broadcasting!

Keep in mind that what a westerner might interpret as intentionally feminine, a Japanese viewer might interpret as simply old. By modern standards, male dress from the Heian era was fairly feminine. (Similarly, when a westerner sees a painting of a horseman from the high middle ages, the high-heels don't make said horseman look feminine)</comment><comment Id="1563" ParentId="2373">To clarify, did you watch the whole series, or just a few episodes?

After he learnt about the multiple shadow clone method to speed up training, he tried using that everytime, unless someone told him he could not use it. With Sage Mode, he was asked to not make more than 4 clones, and later with the Kyuubi mode, he was asked not to make any clones at all. So it is not like he doesn't do that, he is not "allowed" to do it for other reasons.</comment><comment Id="1709" ParentId="2550">Yes but this is for basics meaning he won't waste so much chakara for jutsus like rasen-shuriken, and since Naruto has so much chakara, he just need to mass clones not to the point in where he will turn kyubii but rather just to get the experience.  All Naruto is doing is learning how to manipulate Chakara from himself, rather than using the Chakra around him.  The reason Sage Mode was limited was because of the risk(if one clone turns into a frog he turns into a frog) also the difficulty of hitting the clones.  The point is, that he can do more jutsus when he controls his chakara.</comment><comment Id="1710" ParentId="2550">I get it now, so you are saying he could get over the "it takes too much time to learn" by using mass shadow clones. There may be three reasons why he doesn't. 1. Nobody has pointed that out to him, and even though he has become smarter, he is still too stupid to figure that out himself. 2. Author did not see much value in pursuing that thread now. Naruto has become too badass now, and it would be lame to pursue an arc like that. 3. Author did not think of it this way. He is a human after all with weekly deadlines, he cannot think of all possible scenarios. :)</comment><comment Id="1927" ParentId="2268">you know that Gintama is a comedy anime and does not have a stable plot right?</comment><comment Id="1928" ParentId="2268">@shnisaka Sure, but up to that point he was the main character, and he simply disappeared, as in by the next episode it was as if he never existed.

And yet, Edo Tensei'd ninja do not get tired, nor do they ever run out of chakra.</comment><comment Id="1941" ParentId="2735">Do they? For it to last "forever", they must be involved in an "non-stopping fight", and since dead people cannot feel pain, they might just be using all the chakra of the body, squeezing the muscles and bones out, until there is no more drop of it and, eventually, fall down, not because they are tired, but just because they cannot get any more chakra from the body (and begin "draining" the summoner instead). It might take a lot of time, but perhaps if the fight drew longer, it could've happened.</comment><comment Id="1942" ParentId="2735">I'm not sure about how well versed you are in the Manga. But Madara did things which were beyond human scale, a *lot* of things, and he wasn't even breathing hard. Also, based on latest episodes, it seems as though the jutsu itself has something to do with it (As the Second stated that the technique was improved from last time, and that this time they were resurrected at nearly full power)</comment><comment Id="1960" ParentId="2735">Well, we are not measuring things within the "human" scale, but rather a more lax one, but i can see your point about it, it might be more related to the technique (and therefore, the user's chakra) than the old body's.</comment><comment Id="1966" ParentId="2745">In the english dubs, Edward Elric and Tamaki Suou are both voiced by [Vic Mignogna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Mignogna).

With regard to this, sakura's powerful emotions towards Li had made that happen. Sealed card and the nameless merged in the process, creating the hope card. That is why the Hope Card or the Love Card (Which was called in the english dubbed) was the card who doesn't have a clow card counterpart, meaning it only exist as a Sakura Card because it was created by Sakura's feelings towards Li Syaoran...</comment><comment Id="3251" ParentId="4008">I'm going to edit your answer because that explained better. :)</comment><comment Id="3252" ParentId="4008">By the way, where did the nameless card came from anyway? -_-</comment><comment Id="3255" ParentId="4008">the nameless card was then again, created because of the yearning feeling Sakura has for Syaoran when Syaoran returned back to Hong Kong.

I've seen Pokemon, Yugioh, Crayon Shin-chan, Cardcaptor Sakura, and Sailor Moon there, and I'm sure there are others.

But if he grows old, it won't affect the anime much. That's my opinion.</comment><comment Id="8038" ParentId="6849">@user3289 Both styles of the visuals have artistic beauty. It's the shifted aesthetic of one era to the next that sets them apart. To use a word like "unwatchable" is a bit crass and naive. For an aspect of a whole body of work that is constantly evolving, the differences makes for highly subjective discussion. It's not a bad thing that one is different from another. In the end, it's all about aesthetic. One may appreciate "older" works, while another may prefer newer trends.

It was hinted during the fight between Danzo and Sasuke.</comment><comment Id="16875" ParentId="13427">Oh, as for how Danzo requires Hashirama DNA to use Izanagi, please do remember that he is not an Uchiha, nor a Senju.</comment><comment Id="16917" ParentId="13290">I think your misunderstanding the question.

The post by Kaworu Watashiya says *However, in America, a small child can only take a bath alone.* What age are we talking about here, because letting a child alone in the bathroom, sounds dangerous.</comment><comment Id="16995" ParentId="13472">@PeterRaeves In the manga, Rin takes baths with or in the presence of her guardian (and distant cousin) Reiji from age 5 up to about age 9 or so, when she decides she wants her privacy. That's pretty average for a child here in the US too. My eight-year-old sister still has her mother help her operate the shower. Watashiya's statement was deeply misinformed; American parents do customarily take baths with their children, or help their children in the bath, and are not arrested for it.</comment><comment Id="16996" ParentId="13472">But later on in the manga, the bath scenes take on a weird dimension because we find out that Reiji views Rin as an extension of her mother Aki, with whom Reiji had a sexual relationship, and starts doing things to Rin that border on sexual assault (such as sneaking into her bed and giving her a hickey) while thinking of her as a substitute for Aki. That's the part that many Americans would find offensive, not the bath scenes themselves.</comment><comment Id="16998" ParentId="13478">Interesting! So Japan isn't so different from the US in this regard. All the info I found suggested it was the sexual content involving a child that scuttled the US release of Kodomo no Jikan. The US release of the Cardcaptor Sakura manga, and the DVD releases, were not edited, and no one here cared that much about Fujitaka and Nadeshiko's relationship. There was a little discussion about Rika's relationship with her teacher, which was similar to the relationship in Kodomo no Jikan since it involved an underage character, but lacked the sexual content. Very good answer, +1 from me.</comment><comment Id="17001" ParentId="13472">Ow okay. 9yo would make sense to start caring about ur privacy.

Save them if you can!</comment><comment Id="17123" ParentId="13472">@PeterRaeves I'm curious how Europe received Kojikan too. Anime is so low-profile in the US that our celebrated moral guardians usually ignore it; consequently, we've had some pretty vile stuff, like Night Shift Nurses and MD Geist, come out here with no complaints in sight. I feel like the fans themselves killed Kodomo no Jikan's release, and that it was a one-time thing; I wouldn't expect the same thing to happen in Europe. But like I said, I would think the series would be controversial almost anywhere.</comment><comment Id="17138" ParentId="13472">I can't speak for whole Europe, but here in Flemish Belgium, I doubt it was much of a controversy. Here it's even more low-profile than in the states. The animes you see on TV are only those that are already popular in the US. They don't even bother translating and usually just air them in American anyway. Unless they are so popular that we could use a translation from the Netherlands, but again not much translation is done here and most of the controversy would be dealt in other countries.</comment><comment Id="17143" ParentId="13552">possible duplicate of [What is required for a manga to become an anime?](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11446/what-is-required-for-a-manga-to-become-an-anime)</comment><comment Id="17154" ParentId="13552">@PeterRaeves I updated my question to reflect the key differences between my question and the one you posted.</comment><comment Id="17156" ParentId="13552">You could change your question to ask specifically about how much content (number of chapters or pages or volumes) is required at minimum for a manga to get anime adaptation, otherwise it's a sub-point of the linked question and therefore it's dupe.</comment><comment Id="17158" ParentId="13556">Do you remember anything about the story? i.e. How did the girl survive/live in the fantasy world?</comment><comment Id="17165" ParentId="13558">I am quite sure Maria and Mamoru have a child together, and then Squealer somehow kills Maria and Mamoru and give their bones to the Council.

Over at SFF, many of the major franchises have defined levels of canonicity, e.g. Star Wars has A, B, and C-canon. The movies take precedence over the novels and video games and animated series, but some of the novels are considered more canonical than some of the other media. So far as I know, there's no such definition for Pokemon, making canon conflicts hard to resolve.</comment><comment Id="17389" ParentId="13658">+1, but if I'm not mistaken, the Excel Saga anime has a timeline/plot fairly distinct from the manga (not sure though since I haven't read it - but that's what's reported on Wikipedia and some other places).</comment><comment Id="17390" ParentId="13658">alrighty, I'll just replace it with another example</comment><comment Id="17415" ParentId="13673">There are a bunch of recommendation sites (e.g. Hummingbird iirc, Tastekid) that may also involve anime recommendations.</comment><comment Id="17450" ParentId="13693">This is it!.

I believe there's some confusion here with the word shock. He got his memories back because he paid a visit to the "inner door/god/truth" which was triggered by his shock with Martel's death. His meeting with truth is what returned his memories.  This is also what's stated by the wikia.</comment><comment Id="17807" ParentId="11524">@UsamaArshad's point is that Al's memories were _taken_ by shock, not _returned_ by it.

Why I have a hard time believing this, is because of the power a Logia user holds. I always thought you couldn't hurt Logia users unless you'd have Haki, but if that was true, you could kill them in various ways, like take them by surprise, should them from afar, kill them in their sleep, etc?</comment><comment Id="18730" ParentId="14459">If with 'weak ones', you mean lack of Haki, then you have quite a lot of examples. Pre-timeskip you'd have Smoker, Crocodile and Ace. Post-timeskip you'd have Caribou, Caesar, Monet and Trebol. None which are seen using Haki.</comment><comment Id="18731" ParentId="14459">all, [Caribou](http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Caribou) can't or has not.</comment><comment Id="18734" ParentId="14459">By 'weak' i mean without **observation haki**. Crocodile was good example for @mirroroftruth answer. So we assume logia type can be countered by no-haki users. Monet shows that if logia user is terrified they can loss their ability to use their powers (for sometime ofc.)... Maybe you are right and they dont have observation haki ;) or maybe have but very bad one, maybe more like 'fighing experience'.</comment><comment Id="18737" ParentId="14436">It's not automatic unless the user trains themselves to do it. If Smoker had felt a knife going into his back he might have reacted faster. The point about Logias is that most of them have trained to reflexively react to attacks by transforming, like a martial artist training himself to always protect himself when he falls or is thrown.  They're just humans and not invincible. Another example would be if a Smoker had Tashigi behind him and Luffy had attacked with a knife he might have chosen not to become smoke to take the hit. His default form is flesh, not Smoke.</comment><comment Id="18739" ParentId="14436">Ok thanks. That makes sense. Although it makes you wonder what Trebol must have looked like as a human though since he always looks like he's in slime form, but it makes sense.

While songs are frequently "written for the anime" in the sense that the musician is often requested to write a song that will be used as the anime's opening, at the same time they are usually not "composed solely" for the show.  The songs are intentionally written with generic-ish lyrics most of the time, with the idea that if it has appeal outside the anime, even people who do not watch will buy it, and they are using the anime as a vehicle for extra exposure for the group and the song.</comment><comment Id="20370" ParentId="15581">@Kai I mean, sure, but that's not what the question was asking, as far as I can tell.

One is censorship (Tokyo Ghoul), and the other is Shaft's utter inability to do things right the first time (Mekakucity Actors). I don't think censorship is particularly unique to anime, but there is certainly something to be said for the huge changes that some studios make between the TV and BD releases (Shaft foremost among them). I'd say this is enabled by the fact that you can have your animators redraw scenes later on, whereas you can't bring back your cast of actors to reshoot a botched scene. I'll probably write an answer later.</comment><comment Id="21501" ParentId="16692">In my opinion, I don't think it is the first one, since Assassin is a swordman, not a ninja, and there is no need to hide his sword.

The target audience for many anime/manga is not school-age children, but many of those still depict characters of this age. This may be difficult to discern just from anime, but if you look at the related medium of Visual Novels, the fraction of VNs taking place in a school is rather high, and yet many of them are rated as 18+, meaning that minors aren't their target audience.

Anime is designed for a much wider audience and is normally aired on TV first while Hentai is designed for an adult audience (legally adult normally begins between 18 and 21) and normally strait to DVD. Visual Novels on the other hand are a different media and in a lot of cases their rating are totally separate from the established ratings of film/animation. also Hentai anime/Manga/visual novels are never out on display in shops (to my knowledge) so they don't get as much exposure to the public as what their non H counterparts would get</comment><comment Id="23887" ParentId="18689">I strongly feel the tagging of this question is wrong.

Apart from Madara himself, there is no example of the eye being transplanted at young age to an Uchiha. From what I see, Kakashi and Nagato's cases are very similar (non-Uchiha, implanted for a long time), so shouldn't we able to get a conclusion from there? From your logic, I can see that Kakashi (+Nagato) and Obito's case shows Uchiha bloodline is not enough, and the person must have time to master the eyes. However, there is not enough proof to say that only the owner can revert the eye.</comment><comment Id="27648" ParentId="20501">... Anyway, that is just my doubt looking at it from a logical perspective.

So I had to detail the answer in a way that covers both; Sharingan from Kakashi and Rinnegan from Obito. But I suppose you're right . The part about Obito doesn't contribute much. I'll edit that part out. And about the ownership, wiki states Kakashi's Sharingan couldn't revert the eye because of the ownership issue. Since the Rinnegan evolved from sharingan, I suppose the same principle works. Thanks for the edit btw :)</comment><comment Id="27650" ParentId="20501">@nhahtdh Oh I remembered just now..

But thew definition says that they can create a limitless amount of their element, they never said that you needed training. But logias still do not need to train nearly as much to reach effective standards of power. And as for the manipulation aspect, if they can control their element without actually being in contact with it, they should be having a field day on others. And the amount of creativity in a logias attack is fodder in comparison to a peremica, or non DF user. It's usally blasts or some sort of blade.</comment><comment Id="27851" ParentId="20640">they could do a lot more with the powers given to them</comment><comment Id="27852" ParentId="20640">But i understand what you mean, there are lots of tactics around logia types and even they are weak if they are against an expierenced person who can deal with DF users. I just wish the anime how far the general logia could go, cause it seems like they have a well of dangerous power that can be manipulated like no other DF users can do their own, yet it is not nearly as capatilized on like paramecias and zoans do. A case of taking advantage of the badassery that be a logia devil fruits capabilities.</comment><comment Id="27859" ParentId="20640">@HellionCazzy You should see the Marineford Arc again, the destructiveness of logia powers is shown pretty well during that arc.</comment><comment Id="27868" ParentId="20640">But if they can manipulate their element how ever they please (meaning with or without it being in physical contact) and have limitless power to produce more of said element, they could do so much. Couldn't they mold things out ofthere element and force there opponent to doge everything that said mold sends at them? It seems as if a Logia type does not even have to move to fight, they could do a Gara type thing and have a shell of there  element around to guard offf haki users attacks other logia attacks.</comment><comment Id="27872" ParentId="20640">@HellionCazzy Three things I believe where you really overestimate logia powers. First I don't believe they can manipulate things they are not in contact with. Could you give me an example when this happened? Second, what you are suggesting is exactly what Sakazuki did during the war. He threw lots of lavafists at the pirates, yet many survived. Third, they could indeed form a shield around their bodies, but before you think it makes them invincible, look at Trebol and tell me how his shield worked out for him ;)</comment><comment Id="27873" ParentId="20640">Additional to my first point, logia users can just create destructive balls and can throw them at others, but as far as i know, they can't manipulate them after they are thrown. Unless you could give me a counter example?</comment><comment Id="27875" ParentId="20640">I don't know if they can but the definition dose not say that they can not do such things and Oda has never stated a logia couldn't nor the anime. So i may just be overestimating logia. Still, putting a shield up would give them a way better chance of not taking damage, maybe they don't do it because of their fighting style or because that certain logia doesn't allow them to but it doesn't  since as to why more aren't using a shield.</comment><comment Id="27876" ParentId="20640">@HellionCazzy Trebol is a logia user who put up a shield like you said, yet he was defeated easily. Law just cut right through his shield, so I don't think it would really help them as much as you think.</comment><comment Id="27877" ParentId="20640">I get what you're saying. I think I am thinking of the non DF users as having regular peoples limits. When they do not. I wish more creativity would be used by them though (logias).</comment><comment Id="27905" ParentId="20653">That helped, I wasn't completely grasping how far a logia could go in manipulation and quantity with their element. I have another question about logias, so maybe you'll be able to answer when I make it.</comment><comment Id="27956" ParentId="20571">Regarding to your 2nd picture: I think Law used his devil fruit ability to cut him, like he did several times before (without killing his opponent). But you are right, Lysop also cutted him. My speculation: Trebol is logia type. He just wanted to confuse Luffy by asking "Am I really logia?". Logia have two "main abilities": transform their body into their element AND creating their element. So I think the slime which got hit by Luffy was a "created slime", not his "body slime". But, honestly, this would disappoint me if this is the way how a haki user can hit or not hit a logia user.</comment><comment Id="27958" ParentId="20571">@Munchkin Well it does make sense though. He created kind of an armor. It is like Monet her wings. If she was hit in the wings she would also not be hurt and could rebuild them, because they are snow and not part of her original body. So in a way it does make sense and pretty smart of Trebol to hide his body like that</comment><comment Id="27960" ParentId="11722">at the end of sao 2 kirito said he was gonna climb aincrad and asked his sister if she wanted to go with him so im guessing in sao 3 they wil go back and clear the game for real</comment><comment Id="27961" ParentId="11722">@user13787 The next arc involves Gun Gale Online. Do you have any sources to back this up?</comment><comment Id="27970" ParentId="20695">When I think more about it: A logia user could just create tons of his element and transform his body also into his element - this would give a haki user only a minimal chance to hit the correct body element. I think it's not that easy. Remember Smoker vs. Vergo: Vergo always hit the correct "body smoke". Luck? I don't think so. I can't find a source, but I can remember Rayleigh saying sth. like: "haki user can "feel" the body of logia types". So I think Vergo, who is a haki-master, was able to "feel" Smokers real body. But Luffy, who just learned to use haki, isn't able yet to "feel" it.</comment><comment Id="28000" ParentId="20695">Exactly. All Luffy was hitting was the fake body which wasn't an extension of Trebol's real body. Between Luffy punching holes through his body and Usopp cutting him into pieces, Trebol has to be a Logia.

Thanks a lot for the detailed and illustrated answer, I'll dig in that direction. Apparently, the woman-piloted winglet-equipped fighter-filled space is more abundant than I thought. I'll wait a bit for other versions and, most likely, accept your answer.</comment><comment Id="28147" ParentId="20773">@Gao I've made corrections to the question regarding the winglet and craft design. Unfortunately, I can't remember any more details. I've seen only a few minutes into the movie, and it was many years ago (around 1992-94). If it can be of any help, it was a bootlegged VHS in Russia (those were abundant in ex-USSR). Since most of those pirated cassettes were re-recorded from several bootlegged sources, there actually was a finite number of movies/anime circulating around. So maybe someone here on SE could've seen the a copy of the same cassette.</comment><comment Id="28212" ParentId="20571">Just now I saw this on one-piece wiki

_In Trebol's particular usage, he made it appear as though the fruit's power is that of a Logia, by covering himself in a thick coat of mucus around his emaciated body, which the opponents would assume to be part of his body and believe it to be intangible when attacking that empty space inside the mucus shell, giving him an advantage over enemies who fall for this ploy._</comment><comment Id="28214" ParentId="20571">@pap they indeed changed the type of his fruit.

also what bell means by it being too precious to him is that it has sentimental value for him as he was almost killed by a minotaur in one of the previous episodes, so he thought of it as something that proved he overcame his previous weakness and fear.</comment><comment Id="31474" ParentId="22163">yeah of course that's what im talking about the  "precious" term NOT the value for its exchange.

Even Fairy Tail's magic powers are similar to One Piece's Devil Fruit powers, but I think as long as he does not create a cartoon about pirates and Devil Fruits, I think he is fine.

Ugh, Ash should have his license revoked). Even with godly IV it will be weak, making it useful only for breeding more pikas.

It's obvious that Jessie, James, and Meowth are grossly incompetent and having them constantly trying to steal Pikachu keeps them out of the way and busy.

Light yelling "Misa, write down their names!" by itself wouldn't have been any kind of evidence, but Near had evidence which the original L had collected that strongly suggested Misa was the Second Kira and had killed several people--and yet he chose not to arrest her.

(Accumulating way too few Rin points will lead to a dead end at some earlier point.)  But I don't understand why Rin would have chosen to make Saber a familiar just based off of that.

In the anime, Rin does seem to like Saber, and maybe we can assume that in the good ending she noticed Shirou growing closer to Saber and decided to keep Saber around for his sake. But I'm just speculating; I haven't even finished the Fate route, so I have no idea what Rin and Saber's relationship is like in the visual novel Unlimited Blade Works.</comment><comment Id="34311" ParentId="23856">I thought the Saber points influenced Saber's wilingness to destroy the grail: not enough and she must be commanded to do it, but enough and she overcomes her desire for the grail to do it on her own.  Rin's exact motivations for keeping her around are still in question, of course.  She claims that Saber is effectively an extremely powerful familiar the likes of which no modern magus can boast, albeit at the cost of draining her mana to the point where she can perform virtually no magecraft.  I can't recall other specific details to support this thought, however.</comment><comment Id="34346" ParentId="19232">`then Annie's transformation in the forest would have degenerated (no/minimal sunlight there).` There are many titans who comes to devour the Annie Titan's body when she lets out a roar, so the light in the forest seems to be sufficient for the Titans to operate normally.</comment><comment Id="34349" ParentId="19232">@nhahtdh Even despite that, from chapter 38, we have clear evidence that titans can move around in the dark just fine and not just Titan Shifters, but regular titans as well.</comment><comment Id="34395" ParentId="2755">@j0chn While ep 19 and 20 were indeed filler, they were punished in the manga.

How does Itachi know about Obito?</comment><comment Id="34531" ParentId="24004">It is just a personal opinion. Itachi was smart enough to reason that Madara would not be still alive unless he has some eternal "youth jutsu". So he must have deduced that it wasn't Madara but someone else who is just using the name of Madara. Also, Madara had nothing against Uchiha clan, he had always wanted to make Uchiha more powerful. So Tobi was not Madara. Also, if Itachi could perform tsukuyomi on Tobi, he could have known Tobi's secret identity but he did not want any bad blood. He was saving his life for Sasuke...

I also often see the Japanese refer to alpaca while watching videos on NicoDou... though I'm not sure if [NicoNicoPedia](http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%91%E3%82%AB) (Japanese) could give a hint why alpaca is popular there.</comment><comment Id="35189" ParentId="24392">A 'story within a story', where you tell a very brief account of separate events to make or explain a point is called an 'anecdote', and isn't isolated to manga alone. A manga that tells its story in 4 panel segments is called a 4koma. Do either of these describe what you're after?</comment><comment Id="35190" ParentId="24392">You're close, I'm looking for a kind of synonym to "meme" but not so general. Essentially the point of the 4koma would be to expose some cliche or a bit size joke, so I need a word for the "conclusion" that it makes. For "memes" for example one can discern a "use-case" where you encounter a situation and relay that "meme" as a perfect response, or an all encompassing conclusion. So every time you want to ...insert word... (make a 4koma) about some peculiarity of life you use this.</comment><comment Id="35192" ParentId="24392">I'm not too sure then, unfortunately. Just for clarity, are you asking more about what you would call the 'climax' panel of a 4koma? (Or what you'd call the contents of said panel?)</comment><comment Id="35197" ParentId="24392">Now that I think about it, with your references, I'm asking for a synonym for Yonkoma as a unit. Let's call it "a sketch". In a manga volume, for example, the first n panels discuss some subject, then the setting changes and some other part of the story is discussed, and so on.</comment><comment Id="35198" ParentId="24392">One of these settings is "Life at the seaside" for example, and the author uses 3-4 sketches (one in the house, one playing volleyball, one swimming and another just sunbathing) to make some points that enforce the "Life at the seaside" story. This sketch where the setting doesn't change, characters are rather set (one or many may enter or exit) where the entire discussion revolves around a specific person or activity. Does it have a name? a generic one... PS. Does the climax panel have a specific name and/or characteristic?</comment><comment Id="35200" ParentId="24392">Right, I get what you're asking now, but I don't think I know the answer, sorry :L And the last (climax) panel of a 4koma is usually just the place where the punchline is, I can't think of any special characteristics aside from that. The Wikipedia page on 4komas calls the last panel "Ketsu&#160;(&#32080;)", if that helps.</comment><comment Id="35201" ParentId="24392">@unmircea While in the traditional conception of Japanese narrative, you would probably call the fourth panel of a 4koma the _ketsu_ / "conclusion", in casual conversation, one would more likely call it the _ochi_, which just means "punchline".</comment><comment Id="35297" ParentId="24448">NOTE: the last bit about Charles I ask because Bartley says later on that he believes the reason for most of the Wars were to secure Geass related Ruins like the ones found at Kamine Island and am curious which Areas Charles have conquered which possibly have Geass Ruins</comment><comment Id="35362" ParentId="24481">Do you know which Area was the first to be conquered while Charles was on the throne given that they are numbered in order by conquest?</comment><comment Id="35366" ParentId="24481">@Memor-X I watched the anime again and their is no mention about your question.

In 1998 they overtook the Emperor of Britannia using Geass and started searching the elevators by conquering Canada.</comment><comment Id="35403" ParentId="24392">I've seen the sort of group of connected 4koma strips that you mention [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/24392/7579#comment35198_24392) called a "scene" or "chapter". In the tankoubon, each one has its own title page, like the chapters in traditional multikoma manga. Is that what you're asking about? I'm interested in this question, but right now, between the main question and the comments, things are pretty muddled; if you could edit the question itself to more clearly explain what you're looking for, that would be a big help.</comment><comment Id="35429" ParentId="24392">True! We're close but no cigar. I guess the closest in your answer is a "scene" or "theme". To detail a little bit, one such scene would show the character chemistry, how in a certain "context" a different mix of characters end up with different results. The "theme" of loneliness is one example, throughout a manga (multiple volumes) this context is repeated again and again and character's personalities are explored in how they deal with the situation.</comment><comment Id="35430" ParentId="24392">The characters themselves might be completely different or just the same character at a different time in their lives and they go through this "wheel of life" again and so on... I guess "theme" is good but too general... IDK It seems like a game really, imagine a baseball manga. The game is there and every player takes turns to be the batter. It seems they all have to go through this "game" and we explore each of their personalities under the pressure to perform. Taking characters like this and having them take turns to play the role in the same "game" to see how it feels.</comment><comment Id="35432" ParentId="23535">I am talking about the anime here.

Combined with the stuff I put in the spoilers, I'm slightly uncertain about that.</comment><comment Id="35514" ParentId="24562">But in any case, is what you're trying to get at that in the good path, there would be less tension between the destruction of the Grail (which I think Saber agrees with) and Saber's ties to Shiro in UBW's good ending, on account of the fact that Shiro isn't her master anyway? (Thinking of it, I should probably reread the end of UBW since I might have just missed something.)</comment><comment Id="35518" ParentId="23856">FWIW, [the second BD box-set for UBW (out in October)](http://www.amazon.co.jp/night-Unlimited-Blade-Blu-ray-%E2%85%A1%E3%80%90%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E7%94%9F%E7%94%A3%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E7%89%88%E3%80%91/dp/B00W6HGXUG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441238121&amp;sr=8-1) will include a ~10-minute animated segment that covers the Good Ending. I doubt it'll provide any additional insight, but still.</comment><comment Id="35841" ParentId="25763">I have no idea what you're asking. **Mechanics** is an area of science concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.  A **narrative** or story is any report of connected events, actual or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, or still or moving images.

I don't think anyone can survive such massive amount of energy</comment><comment Id="39436" ParentId="8042">While I think that genetics may have helped, we can see that if you are one of the 10% who can naturally use magic, you can choose whatever you want, just like how Sho, Milliana, or Wally was able to choose their magic, and how Makarov was able to use multiple magics at once (Titan, Light...).  So I feel like no, Mira, Elfman, and Lisanna all chose Take Over magic.</comment><comment Id="39441" ParentId="28171">Though the gravitational pull is more near a blackhole, still there could be planets around with their own gravity like Planet earth. Their life span will be very less relatively. He can teleport himself to one of those planets and make a comeback. Narutopedia says, "By absorbing their own body into this distortion, the user can teleport to virtually any location they desire"  (http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kamui). I don't think its very difficult to create his own version of spacesuit.</comment><comment Id="39450" ParentId="28171">You are forgetting the fact that Kamui has a time delay. The matter around the black hole moves very fast due to the acceleration from the black hole's gravity. Before he can use the jutsu, he'd die from the energies around him. Also, I think you underestimate the amount of energy around the black hole. Obito would need a  space suit that can withstand star-level energy and ultra-massive gravitational pull that'd rip his body to pieces.</comment><comment Id="39452" ParentId="28171">I do agree that Kamui has time delay, but the delay happens only while moving In/Out of the dimension. So, that shouldn't be a problem. Let it take even 1 min to enter into the planet from the 4th dimension, that's fine. Second, I am not underestimating the gravitational pull of a black hole. and I am not saying he has to dive inside the black hole or orbit around it. He can move to a planet which has its own gravity and orbiting its own star which is closer to a black hole relative to the earth.</comment><comment Id="39453" ParentId="28171">I think we are going off-topic, should we continue this? lol</comment><comment Id="39454" ParentId="28171">@KaguyaOtsutsuki Move to Maid-Cafe chat room, then.</comment><comment Id="39465" ParentId="28202">I think Shanks knew what Luffy's Devil Fruit would do before he ate it. at least that was the impression i got</comment><comment Id="39466" ParentId="28202">Possible duplicate :http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/5919/6345</comment><comment Id="39475" ParentId="28205">I am pretty sure the existence of such a book is canon.

(ever try swinging your arms with your legs when you walk, For me, i physically tilt when i do). the classic running arms is an easier way to swing them faster and when we run we tilt forward and so does the balance requirement (the fists barely if at all go behind the body during the run) Ninja not only run faster but are marathon runners (its days of running to reach another village) and may need to fight in the middle of that journey.

The VHS tapes I used to have are no longer playable (damned EP tapes!), and all I have now is about 5 subbed episodes that I found on the internet ten years ago. It's a shame these aren't subbed officially and released on DVD or blu-ray. The show is absolutely hilarious and fun!</comment><comment Id="43572" ParentId="11235">They were broadcast by [KIKU-TV](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/company.php?id=4973) in Hawaii.

There is no good way to directly-translate "Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou" into English (because the title is a pun), so instead we have "The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior" (also a pun, but a different one).

Thematically, though, if we take the interpretation that Shinji choking Asuka was his way of confirming that rejection and denial still exist, Asuka stroking Shinji should probably mean that acceptance also still exists, even when all the hearts are separated. Shinji refused to get close to anyone because he feared rejection; Asuka constantly rejected everyone. Shinji had to learn to stop fearing rejection, and Asuka had to learn to stop rejecting everyone out of hand.</comment><comment Id="47047" ParentId="34179">Also, this scene echoes an earlier one during Instrumentality when Shinji chokes Asuka while arguing with her about whose fault it is that they were never able to get closer. Asuka caressing Shinji could also be interpreted as her admitting her own fault, and pledging to try harder to correct her own flaws.</comment><comment Id="47060" ParentId="34194">from what i have read Ichigo lost his powers because he used Final Getsuga Tenshou (before the Fullbringer Arc), i wouldn't really say that's reusable unless being a Fullbringer eliminates that drawback</comment><comment Id="47061" ParentId="34194">Edited to make less 'what if'</comment><comment Id="47075" ParentId="34205">Thank you.. finally! I can properly 'reword my question' to fit 'community guidelines'.. and finally get a proper answer.. is a pain to reword stuff..  Now, fusing with zanpakuto, i think the best theory since there is some of that stuff referenced in OVA.. Blades, the rogue shinigami. Also, he said it himself, he is being the getsuga tenshou himself. However, in the case of Blades.. he cannot cancel it; thats why he stole ichigo power to seperate himself from zanpakuto.. though, im not sure why he wanted to stop the fuse mode..</comment><comment Id="47076" ParentId="34205">If so, if ichigo can keep up with aizen 1:1 combat instead of just kaboom his power to 2:1 (since aizen is not dead yet but sealed xD).. he can keep his getsuga mode forevaaa and be an unsealable, immortal creature since that black hollow+shiningami bakudo didnt work for him.

If they are just ordinary punches and kicks, then these jutsus must be present and used in all the 8 gates since each gate give you a certain amount of power instead of only the 8th gate. I think this is a serious plot hole in the series.</comment><comment Id="47208" ParentId="34261">@Bej each gate powers you up. Just because you can throw a punch does not mean you can throw it fast enough to light it on fire due to friction. They also are not equivalent since you did not know. The first gate only removes the brains restraint on the muscles. no other gate can do that. every gate is completely unique and offers a significant power boost. so significant in fact that guy did not have the power necessary to perform such maneuvers on lower gates. Guy never gets visibly stronger in the series, just opens more gates.</comment><comment Id="47210" ParentId="34261">@jNat Derived jutsu only mean that the parent was used in some way to perform the Derived Jutsu. RasenShuriken is a rasengan, but jutsu like Shadow clone have no direct parent, despite Obviously being a Clone Jutsu. The gates are inbetween, its not that the Jutsu are special or unique, but rather that the strength and speed required to use them is impossible without the gates. No one but Guy lights their own fists on fire due to shear friction, because the speed required is so great that only guy with 6 gates can do it. "punches are so fast, they are set ablaze by sheer speed and friction"wiki</comment><comment Id="47211" ParentId="34261">@JNat Its the same with all the other descriptions on The wiki itself. Morning Peacock is just a Taijutsu combo of a upward kick, then many super high speed punches. Such jutus only exist because of the eight gates, but to learn how to do them, you need only know how to do the basic taijustsu combination, Sasukes Lions barage first kick followed by a simple 1-2 punch combo. If you want to light your fists on fire however,  you need speed only Guy has ever shown. no one else has ever been that fast without cheating via teleportation.</comment><comment Id="47258" ParentId="34281">I dont think that is what OP wants though.

I just thought that there be would some kind of explanation. Rather than a hole in the story.</comment><comment Id="47268" ParentId="34281">To add on to this, Night Guy was basically a superpowered Dynamic Entry, so it was an incredibly practiced technique for Guy. Evening Elephant used the same principles as Hirudora (( attacking with forceful blasts of air)) and with the fact that Guy is a Taijutsu Prodigy, it's not unreasonable to assume he could extend that application to something more powerful in the Eight Gates Released Formation.</comment><comment Id="47273" ParentId="34281">@Bej unfortunatly that is something you need to expect from most stories in general, Its practically true of real life, you can only go so small before you need to just believe what you see. There are thousands of questions you could ask about the Naruto Universe, but few people ask them because they are just a part of the world. Where did the God tree come from, what about chakra, the afterlife, How humans can be so physically strong. No one asks such questions, we just accept that such things are how the naruto world works.</comment><comment Id="47274" ParentId="34326">where did that 1000 times stronger statistic come from?

It doesn't make any sense if the only way to deal more damage was to make the blast bigger, because then its less energy in the area you actually want to hit.</comment><comment Id="47276" ParentId="34330">Have you tried reading the manga to find out? :p Sorry but questions as easy as this are not something this site favors.</comment><comment Id="47279" ParentId="34330">As @Hakase this is an easy answer question that a google search or reading the manga can handle but it is not off-topic.

But well, that proves my point even more</comment><comment Id="47337" ParentId="34326">If you don't remember, Frieza boasted his power level was at about 1 million after his first transformation. Outside of that, Indeed its hard to say the reasoning. I just assumed it was based on density because the higher the density, the more damage that was inflicted in the volume consumed by the blast. I recall Vegeta used FInal Flash agaisnt perfect Cell, which spread out to be almost as big as planet earth after many many miles due to its power. High density in the center, but so much uncompressed energy that it expands rapidly.</comment><comment Id="47339" ParentId="30698">@BlackKnigh7 they are still demons.

It's probably just a new monster. It would be cool if it was a Heathcliff AI though.</comment><comment Id="47873" ParentId="35695">Well we do see that Kayaba does still exist in Alfheim when he contacts Kirito after his fight with "Fairy King Oberon," so this same form might be the boss of New Aincrad.</comment><comment Id="47878" ParentId="35695">To close voters, I think this question is answerable since we know what happened to Heathcliff.

Oda says Nami is the third most intellegent from the east blue below Ben and then Kuro. Kuro is my favorite villain so that is easy to remember. Lucky Roo is the fat guy from romance dawn who shot the bandit while eating a joint of meat. I remember his name thanks to old fan theories about him being the fastest man alive.  I didn't remember Rockstar; I had to read the wiki on him. Apparently he was the one who took a message from Shanks to Whitebeard which the latter tore up (I think i barely remember that).</comment><comment Id="49154" ParentId="36375">So you remember the names of Lucky Roo and Rockstar from sources other than manga/anime, they weren't mentioned there?

Lucky Roo's name was revealled in Vol. 5 SBS.  Ironically, it reads as follows "And the meat-eating fat guy's name is Lucky Roo. There's really no need to remember something like that, but since I got asked enough, I might as well clear it up."  Rockstar is formally introduced in Vol. 25 chapter 243 (again according to the wiki which agregates this stuff that isn't worth remembering).</comment><comment Id="49169" ParentId="36393">I read both, but besides a few overlaps on very rough concepts, like the ones you mention.

Coming to the math, You cannot expect the whole weight of the soil cylinder to be crushing his head because he wasn't buried with a circular structure with the area of the hole placed on his head to take all the weight of the soil dumped on him. The ground around him takes the weight of the soil as well. Plus there seems to be boulders dumped in too, making it impossible to guess the structure of alignment of them pressing on the sides of the hole hence reducing the downward weight on Hidan.</comment><comment Id="49171" ParentId="36393">These are not the only manga/anime to involve the Seven Deadly Sins.

Some readers are denser than others. One of the biggest hints was when Miyu first meet Illya's big brother,  almost mistaking him for her own by calling im onii-chan. Until the big reveal in Drei, no one can be certain of the identity until it is explicitly revealed. Hints are dropped, some more blatant than others.

To learn the jutsu, you would most likely need one who already knows it to teach it to you, something nearly impossible to do without mind control which we all know is pretty much nonexistant or extensive mind reading which is very inconvenient at best.

It resembles a form of Buddhist enlightenment, really.  Failure at this risked death.  The Uchiha were branded, at least by the Second, as dangerous due to their emotional instability and strong passions.  Thus they may have been naturally ill-suited for the acquisition of Sage powers, as they would have found it extremely difficult to achieve the requisite state of mind.</comment><comment Id="49626" ParentId="36832">Do you maybe have some chapter/episode numbers to go along with those statements?</comment><comment Id="49640" ParentId="36748">Nah, I think Rin's bi-curious at most. The h-scene in the V.N (fate route) was a life or death situation and it is an eroge, what happened there would have likeky been the same with other heroines, it's mostly fanservice. Also, the newer fate stay night version (realta nua, which is canon) completely removes that scene. Not to mention that in Fate Hollow Ataraxia once Rin and Shirou start a proper relationship there are several occasions in which Rin makes it clear she just wants Shirou as a love partner (like when Rin invites Shirou on a date to her private pool in her house,.. see next post</comment><comment Id="49641" ParentId="36748">(Shirou says it's a great idea and that he's gonna tell saber and Rin gets super mad. She literally beats Shirou and tells him it's a couple's date, so just the 2 of them will go there). Moreover, I've read everything in the visual novels and there isn't one single scene in which saber even hints she likes Rin that way. A harem happens when +2 people around you loves you and in the visual novel (the source materil) saber literally says in the UBW good ending she's staying just for Shirou</comment><comment Id="49644" ParentId="36748">IMHO the use of the 3 command seals is relevant, but not that important (even without any command seals Rin aks archer to become a familiar.

About the command spells In the true ending Rin has to use the last one to force saber to destroy the Grail with Rin inside (killing her). Rin didn't die cause Archer saved her. In the good ending Saber willingly decides to destroy it (thinking she would kill Rin). So Saber may have stayed in the true ending if Rin had ran to make a new contract with her (as Rin did with archer). After all the true ending is the one where saber can't bring herself to kill Rin</comment><comment Id="49949" ParentId="33">@TylerShads I would think that too, but there are a few things that could counter it. First, she may have split it slowly, over a few years, and possibly have done so a long time in the past. Second, Loosing it is not like gaining it. In a fight, they can use almost all of it up, little consequences, but Yusuke had a sealed bottle that was already full before Genkai shoved several times more than his capacity into it. he had to spend days preventing the bottle from shattering under its own pressure, forcefully increasing its size.

Another proof of that is when Nasu says "it's best if you don't think too much about it," when asked if it doesn't follow the routes. He's avoiding the question. It will be up to the reader to decide if it is a true sequel to all endings or to 1 ending.</comment><comment Id="50261" ParentId="36646">So basically at the very least it deserves the title of one of Nasu's true endings, and depending on the reader's interpretation it could still be the true sequel to Fate Stay Night.</comment><comment Id="50264" ParentId="36646">SUPER IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER: (before that I'd like to say that Nasu's words "it should be left up to the user's imagination" also bear out what I said before).

When Nasu said "don't think too much about it" it was to avoid answering if it's a true sequel to all routes or not, it has nothing to do with it not being serious.</comment><comment Id="50265" ParentId="36646">@Sanji you're taking words too literally here. It's best not to think too much about it. It wasn't meant as a serious work.</comment><comment Id="50270" ParentId="36646">I am stating what he said, you're the one that's giving it the interpretation it wasn't serious work, something he never said. Look at the answers. When asked if it's the true sequel to every route they say "Basically, I think the player should interpret it however he wants" They don't discard it. Then the interviewer asks if it doesn't follow the routes (he didn't get an answer so he asks the same in a different way). Nasu then tells him not to think about it. To me it's clear he tells him to drop it. He can't discard the sequel nor his previous work (both the authors say the reader chooses).</comment><comment Id="50271" ParentId="36646">What he may or may not have said is arbitrary. I never quoted him saying it. You're the one taking this interpretation too literally.</comment><comment Id="50272" ParentId="36646">Well, I just wanted to make it clear he didn't say that. People don't usually read the source material, and while it wasn't quoted, saying "it's mentioned that..." just before dealing with the interview might make it seem it is actually mentioned that way.</comment><comment Id="50338" ParentId="37131">I agree with your interpretation of the interview regarding the true ending of Fate Hollow.</comment><comment Id="50433" ParentId="37131">YES, I don't think KRaZ&#8364;R's statement about the game not being too serious is right either as Sanji suggested in the comments stating Nasu never said that. My question was about that sex scene, but the game itself seems very serious to me. The slice of life scenes accurately reflect the characters motivations and Nasu tells us very important info regarding the past of some of them. Even if it's a time-loop most of the time, the characters themselves are the same ones from FS/N and the true ending, which takes place outside the loop,feels like the direct continuation of the original game to me.</comment><comment Id="50434" ParentId="36748">The command spells serves as the contract between Master and Servants, because as long as the Master has at least one, the Servant can't disobey him/her. A servant can chose to sever a contract after all 3 command spells are used, in True Saber did, in Good she didn't. In both ending Rin used her last one to give Saber a boost to destroy the grail.</comment><comment Id="50435" ParentId="36748">The point of the intermission right after Saber destroy the Grail is to highlight the difference in her mindset. In the True End's intermission (End of Dream), she accepts that she can't change the past (from watching Archer's conflict with Shirou), and give up her chase for the Grail, going back to die. In the Good End (New Wish), she wants to continue watching Shirou and Rin, hence keeping her contract</comment><comment Id="50437" ParentId="37131">For what I've read a dude trolled us by writing in wiki Nasu mentions it's not serious. This is based on his last reply "don't give it too much thought" and some people copy-paste him when talking about Ataraxia. To me, the true ending of Ataraxia is the sequel to FSN not because he says I can interpret it that way but because it is called sequel and the whole game builds up to consider it the sequel. Nasu doesn't do things like that without giving it a lot of thought.</comment><comment Id="50438" ParentId="36748">Regarding Hollow Ataraxia, in Rin's pool scene, when Shirou was caught staring at Rider, she said something to the effect of "its Rider, it can't be helped". Also, in HF's epilogue, she's stunned by Rider's beauty. Not to mention her UST/homoerotic rivalry with Luvia.</comment><comment Id="50439" ParentId="37131">Plus the game is considered canon by Nasu. In my opinion he didn't deny it's the true sequel cause it is, otherwise he would have said it's a parallel world in the last question as the interviewer seems to want him reply. Anyways, thank you for your reply!</comment><comment Id="50441" ParentId="37206">Thank you. I read the game so I know that scene. Most of it was included in the anime's last episode so it's pretty much the canon ending of UBW. I think it may happen in the good ending too (the lovestruck thing), after all Rin heavely hints he will be making love to her and Shirou will always be the same no matter what.</comment><comment Id="50444" ParentId="37206">When I say it was included in the anime's last episode I obviously don't mean the calls themselves to UBW. I mean the key points like Lluvia crushing on him, Rin fighting for him to drive him away from girls (Lluvia in the anime and hrself in the call) and Rin dropping tsun part. This last part is shown in the anime in scenes like her sleeping on Shirou's shoulder in a train where I take it people can watch them or Rin resting her head on Shirou's lap while he caresses her. And they're in the public magical library and she doen't even blush.</comment><comment Id="50445" ParentId="37206">We just lack middle-aged Rin from that scene. In the anime she's just 19 but in a few years she'll just say she loves everything about him lots of times and that she'd do anything for him. Anyways, did you realise that with the exception of the fate route (Last epiode: Shirou x Saber in Avalon) Shirou just has harems? In UBW true Lluvia likes him very much and Nasu mentioned they will have adventures even after graduation; in UBW good ending saber loves him (VN, Rin tells them not to flirt); In Heaven's Feel Rider loves him (amazing love confession in Ataraxia); In Ataraxia he gets everyone.</comment><comment Id="50490" ParentId="37235">Itachi used Izanami, not Izanagi, and the wording of this answer is at best low quality.</comment><comment Id="50523" ParentId="34206">You should identify a person before using a pronoun (Android 18, in this case).

Regarding Fate Hollow in the pool scene Rin was dating Shirou. Once Rider appears Rin says that everything's ruined and that she wanted to show off her body to Shirou. At the end she said "it's Rider, so it can't be helped". She felt frustrated , that's why Shirou told her afterwards that he just loved her and no other girl. About being stunned by her beuty in HF it is because she is the Goddess of beauty, cursed by Athena because she was the most beautiful, cause of envy. And the rivalry with Luvia is basically Luvia flirting with Shirou and Rin getting super mad because of that.</comment><comment Id="50589" ParentId="36748">Returning to the pool scene your quote comes from here: "and here I was all worked up about finally having a chance to surprise you, Emiya-Kun. Well, it is Rider, it can't be helped. Things go wrong at just the critical moment, as always". And about Lluvia, in Heaven's Feel (the route where Shirou isn't dating Rin) it is revealed that Rin is unhappy in the clock tower (no wonder because this time she doesn't have Shirou).     "I've been going out with boys but whenever I am with them I can't concentrate cause that fool's face appears in my mind. Am I in love with him?"</comment><comment Id="50590" ParentId="36748">In this route Rin and Shirou didn't have any romance moments, yet she thinks about Shirou, not Saber, Rider,.. (not to mention she says she's been going out with boys, not girls). She also mentions she wishes she could move in with Shirou. The reason Lluvia, Rin and Shirou have adventures in UBW true is because Lluvia sticks to Shirou and Rin has to adapt to the situation, like she does in every route (like when saber's gone in the fate route and Rin wakes up early to go to school with him or when se fights for him in Ataraxia true ending even though there are already 5 girls doing the same).</comment><comment Id="50592" ParentId="6482">Yamato can make plant based bug, i guess Hashirama have something more powerful/effecient</comment><comment Id="50662" ParentId="33791">@pap  the statement "tons of sites which offer free "legal" almost any" may as well say leave out the "legal" bit, as we all know what air quotes around a term implies.

In UBW good she does that with saber but in the true ending,where Shirou cares less about saber, she does nothing as the anime shows. Saber stays for Shirou in the good ending because she cares about him and he gives her more points in the VN, showing he really wants that. Before dying she thought it was ok cause Shirou didn't need her [read 2nd, 4th comments and Prime's answer] Let's end it here, we all surpassed the allowed comments</comment><comment Id="50735" ParentId="34262">I don't mean to nitpick too much here, but his confidence was not the actual cause of the injury.

Your the one who was talking about skipping levels. (and you should know i was talking about Powering up which is exactly what you were talking about, not attaining new levels.

You say ssj needs to feel like a normal state for ssj2. But that's not actually the case.

The Macross situation is so fubar, you can do a search on why new Macross will likely never come to the USA, cos it's a nightmare.   Also, once fansubbed anime gets on file sharing platforms, it's there forever, and cuts into the anime industry in *insert country here*  Anime is a niche industry, and not buying when a series is licensed = not supporting.</comment><comment Id="52222" ParentId="38400">Regarding last quote, I know it, but in Last Order, she saw him without helmet already (and even in the game, he was carrying her already without helmet).

They're not fire and ice; they're a red flame and a blue flame, each as hot as the other.</comment><comment Id="54398" ParentId="4238">Intended or not, something to consider is aerodynamics. WIth normal running, the arms swinging is for balance, and is otherwise optional. Naruto Ninja run fast, and even the lowest estimates are over 30+MPH (48kph) with high estimates in the 100s. in short bursts, elite ninja can vanish from right infront of you with the body flicker technique. At such speeds, especially when traveling for days like they do for missions, even a small boost in aerodynamic efficiency can be significant, and not punching the wind with every step helps when at any time you can be attacked.</comment><comment Id="54415" ParentId="40118">Piccolo may have used *Hyperbolic time chamber* for training purpose</comment><comment Id="54418" ParentId="40118">yeah, we have to imagine that.

I kind of settled on some explanatory terms but forgot to come back and answer. The "characters" play out their lives in a "setting". Dictionary:  the time, place, and circumstances in which something occurs or develops. So the question still stands... Another good example I managed to figure out, in the case of baseball the answer to my question is a "play". Baseball is the "game" and there a roles each player has to take on for this event to "play" out. One is the batter, one is the catcher, first baseman etc... when all roles are covered, a "play" starts.</comment><comment Id="54617" ParentId="24392">Pitcher throws ball in direction of the batter, the batter swings he may or not hit the ball and so on... when the "play" is over some things are decided, like who the loosing team was, the score based on rules and so on. In the case of manga, multiple characters would "attend" such a "setting". One is John A and three young girls. John A is the protagonist, a high school student, while the two others are, one a yandere, a tsundere and an innocent girl (don't know the name). Now a "play" in this situation would be an exchange of lines that cements their roles as yandere, tsundere etc</comment><comment Id="54618" ParentId="24392">You don't know which one is what in the beginning of the "play" you might have some idea based on your past experience, but when this "setting" "play"s out you are sure which is which.</comment><comment Id="54619" ParentId="40290">That's exactly why i asked.

Useful for spying. But Naruto also uses that trick to greatly speed up his training with Jiraiya and Yamato.</comment><comment Id="55307" ParentId="40895">I disagree on the fact that it's chakra related. Yes Naruto has significantly more chakra due to Kurama, however Kakashi uses Shadow Clones multiple times throughout the series.

My guess is it's either "is there a chance for us to be accepted by the population of the world (despite an incestuous relationship)?" or a metaphor for "may we be able to calm down our lust enough to get a grip on the solid ground of decency?" And as always, "serious writings" in anime (especially in comedies like this one) tend to have references to actual serious works. Someone who is familiar with japanese literature might be able to recognize that last sentence from some popular classical poetry.</comment><comment Id="55330" ParentId="40930">@Hakase I was thinking that too, but I thought it was a reference to something that's specific to otaku culture... Can this be migrated there then?</comment><comment Id="55342" ParentId="40953">I don't quite follow you. I understood that "thrown out the window" is the primary meaning in English. I also agree with your characterization of what the intended meaning is. Where I get lost is you saying it is a "literal translation" contrasted with you also saying you haven't watched it yet. That implies to me that you have not heard the Japanese, so what exactly do you mean by "literal translation"? It won't surprise me if Japanese actually used word(s) that literally mean "thrown out the window", but is that what you are saying?</comment><comment Id="55345" ParentId="40953">Well, a lot of subbed videos have the literal translation where the vocabulary may not exactly fit with the meaning. Others are translated based on the meaning. The term "defenestrated" here is a bit weird because "defenestrated" is supposed to be for people- not something intangible like ideas. So the character may want to say that the idea was thrown out the window but the literal translation was "defenestrate".</comment><comment Id="55377" ParentId="40991">Is that the story in the original Japanese anime, or is that the plot from the Funimation dub? Because the episode "Get Your Hands Off My Happy Cake" shows Penny (Nene) buying the bunny from a store and the bunny telling the story of a child with bleeding hands sewing his plastic nose and lamenting how life was unfair</comment><comment Id="55380" ParentId="40998">Cool, thank you! It is interesting that both Japanese and English would use the concept of "throwing out a window" in the same figurative meaning as "dismiss" or "ignore". There are many other concepts which could be used, such a "thrown out a door", "fed to rats", or "written with no ink". Yet both languages settled on the window thing.</comment><comment Id="55381" ParentId="40998">Yeah, that is interesting. I'm still puzzling over it, in fact- I can't imagine that using that phrase figuratively is all that common in Japanese. Doing a sentence search on jisho.org didn't result in any similar uses of &#12414;&#12393; and &#25448;&#12390;&#12427; that I could tell, and a Google search yielded a few examples of throwing _things_ out of windows, and one possibly figurative use.

Those should count as different transformations or not?</comment><comment Id="57764" ParentId="43037">We do not know what Kale's transformation exactly is until she manages to control her current power. SSJ3 is an existing transformation, even if Kale or Caulifla gets it, it would be no different than the SSJ3 Goku and Gotenks have. Finally, the ultra super saiyan is not really a transformation. You could consider it as an unmastered SSJ2 transformation since it's only a power up, so I wouldn't really consider than an official transformation.</comment><comment Id="57772" ParentId="43037">I think Ultra Instinct is not a transformation, but a technique or rather, a form. It's a power to be unlocked by training and not something to just attain by being forced to the limits and screaming at the top of your lungs. As is said by Whis, Goku was able to unlock it by breaking through his potential barrier while clashing with the spirit bomb's energy.</comment><comment Id="57781" ParentId="43037">+Pratyush Manocha Ultra Instict is a skill but it is used in the form of a transformation by goku. This can be compared to Gohan's mystic transformation. Although it's only his potential being unlocked, we still see a new aura and the bang of hair drop down when he uses that power. If goku utilised Ultra instinct as a skill, he would've been able to utilise it while he is using SSJ or even in his base form. We see a new auro and the color of his eyes change. Hence it is a form of transformation.</comment><comment Id="57785" ParentId="43037">Ultra Instinct doesn't fit in this list as it is nothing ki related and it isn't a super saiyan form. It is a state of the body that Goku unlocked by coincendence. Mystic/Ultimate Gohan is comparable to kaio-ken in terms of powering up so it isn't super saiyan related either. I wont edit them out of the answer due to the interesting comments that other users might find significant to know.</comment><comment Id="57786" ParentId="43037">I'd like to disagree with you over here. Ultra Instinct is still in it's budding stage, and what was shown in the anime is, incomplete. The reason being that Goku had an aura while the original poster showing him in this state has no such aura. As for using it in SSJ, I'd like to say that it'd be useless and just a wastage of energy and hence, won't be used coupled with another form. None of this makes it a possible candidate for a transformation though. Now, if you want to argue that since it's incomplete, it's still a transformation, then it'd be useless to discuss it further.</comment><comment Id="57790" ParentId="42983">I editted the question based on the context of the comments.

Now you have the potential to live to 535 (which probably wont happen).

Plus that they had limited resurces, so maybe they were limited in the number of prototypes they could build (they could harvest resources from asteroids like in Knights of Sidonia, but it's not shown).

As of currently written, the only relevant part of the answer is "*Its also very likely, Darkness has money saved up.

The only basis to say that is the fact that Most Jonin have by the time they become Jonin have learned how to use more than 1 nature as said by Kakashi. Your natural element does not prevent you from using any other elements, but usually if you have more than one natural element, you also have a Kekkei Genkai, which are not released forms, but just combined elements. Also, The Rasengan is a non elemental Jutsu, it did more damage than the Chidori because its an explosive torrent of chakra, instead of a piercing stab.</comment><comment Id="62999" ParentId="49035">Vegeta is older than goku, you can see in series it is stated that when freeza destorys planet Vegeta, vegeta was with Nappa somewhere else, where Goku was just born</comment><comment Id="63004" ParentId="49043">Did you mean to say that their physical bodies are several years older than their actual ages, rather than younger?

It's possible that this would be revealed in Boruto later on or maybe Kodachi forgot about it. Or it might yet to be revealed that Wood Release can be inherited but it is possible that it skips some of the descendants, and she could be a descendant of the First. This could be a plot hole, though.

If I remember correctly, they weren't wiped out completely, as seen in the manga. While the wikia states that they 'were wiped out' by Shinigami to maintain balance, there were still surviving Quincies after the operation. Hence, they were able to populate, although being strictly monitored.</comment><comment Id="63942" ParentId="49953">The choice of words are confusing, I know ('wiped out' was also use in the VIZ translations). All you need to remember is that their population slowly decreased throughout the years and their numbers did not disappear in one instant, there are still survivors.</comment><comment Id="65155" ParentId="50122">In the 2011 version of ep.8, Bendot only says, "I propose a death match." No option of surrender is mentioned. Ep. 13 of the 1999 version is like you report the manga says, including Bendot saying "admits defeat or one is killed" at 15:22. Prior to that he also delivers the speech Lippo gives in 2011, including a match is over when one side admits defeat.  So I see your point, but I remain unconvinced that the general instruction (allowing admission of defeat) is not valid for all matches.</comment><comment Id="65168" ParentId="50141">Heh, that was unexpected.  Out of curiousity I checked [chapter 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuFbOigeXA0) of the 1999 version. At TC 14:53 Kurapika is holding Majitni up by his chin, and the latter manages to get out just, "Okay! I...".  He did not say, "I surrender!". It seems weird that the 2011 version would show that he did.</comment><comment Id="65169" ParentId="50141">@RichF Yeah, it sure is. I just started reading the manga last week (haven't gotten around to watching the anime yet) and after looking up differences in the 1999 and 2011 anime from the manga, I feel like the 1999 anime is more faithful compared to the new one. They probably thought some of the changes made in the 2011 anime are small and would go unnoticed, especially those that they probably thought would not affect the plot significantly. Why they would change details like these, when they could just follow what the manga depicts in the first place, is a mystery to me.</comment><comment Id="65173" ParentId="50141">Some people say they don't like the 1999 version because of filler. Yes, it has some non-canonical stuff, but it is all really good and adds a lot to characterization. Besides, I'd rather have extra stuff than leave out a major character for 70-odd episodes, which 2011 does.  What's the opposite of filler?  "Drainer"? One such non-canonical scene is one of the best, almost silent, expository scenes in anime.  If you've read through phase 3 of Hunter Exam, take a look at the first 11 minutes of 1999's [episode 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ2pgoH_AHc). Gon is still paralyzed ...</comment><comment Id="65179" ParentId="50141">@RichF 'I'd rather have extra stuff than leave out a major character for 70-odd episodes' Agreed. I don't really mind filler in anime, and especially in this case because Gon's character and past were never explored that much in the manga, at least in the early chapters. I was also really surprised after finding out a character was left out in the early parts. For me, it's a significant change as their meeting and conservation was also part of the reason that solidified Gon's goal of becoming a hunter and finding his father.</comment><comment Id="65201" ParentId="50181">Thank you very much for your earnest reply!

There are several buildings of various sizes in each town. Plus, there are houses of varying sizes which he have no idea about. The only reasonably way I can think off, to estimate the distance traveled in the anime, would be, to study the script extensively and look for lines between characters where there is any mention of distance.

I also watched the anime first before reading the manga and during watching, the thought of the top 10 heroes being a worldwide ranking never occurred to me. I have always assumed that the top heroes repeatedly mentioned throughout the anime must be part of the Japanese ranking only.</comment><comment Id="67810" ParentId="53702">Although with the latest movie, I am not sure if the manga would finally involve events and story arcs centered outside Japan. By the way, the rankings were shown after the Shie Hassaikai Arc, which would probably explain why anime watchers do not know about it.

In some cases, it seems to be purely power-based. In other cases, it also seems to factor in the ability of the user to wield those powers. For example, you can easily argue that Mugino (#4) is stronger than Misaka (#3) from a sheer power standpoint. But Misaka has composure and can "more intelligently" use her powers whereas Mugino is kinda... mentally unstable and just blasts with more emotion than thought.</comment><comment Id="67843" ParentId="53761">if Imagine breaker is not an esper ability, why do they consider him an esper then?</comment><comment Id="67844" ParentId="53761">@Pablo Anyone who's gone through the Power Curriculum Program, the esper part of the curriculum at Academy City, is considered an esper even if they never demonstrate any esper powers.  Most of the Academy students (60%) are level 0s, so having no powers (or an insignificant power) and being considered an esper is actually fairly common. https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Curriculum_Program</comment><comment Id="67873" ParentId="48281">That manga coloring could be a fan art?

If you have two questions, it's better to split them into two actual questions (as in, two separate posts). That way, they can also have more specific titles too.

No one is immune to genjutsu, not even Jinchuriki. The fact here is that when the Jinchuriki falls for the genjutsu, the sealed bijuu can support the jinchuriki to get away from genjutsu by destabilizing the chakra. Why only Killer Bee was able to cast away a genjutus is that he was known to have built a great bond with Hachibi, so both of them act as a team to overcome genjutsu.</comment><comment Id="69513" ParentId="55555">Edited it.
